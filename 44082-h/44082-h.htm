<p class="center chap2">REALISM IN ENGLAND</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> year 1849 was made famous by a momentous interruption in the
quiet course of English art brought about by the pre-Raphaelites. A
movement, recalling the Renaissance, laid hold of the spirit of painters. In
all studios artists spoke a language which had never been heard there before;
all great reputations were overthrown; the most celebrated Cinquecentisti,
whose names had hitherto been mentioned with respectful awe, were referred
to with a shrug as bunglers. A miracle seemed to have taken place in the world,
for the muse of painting was removed from the pedestal on which she had
stood for three centuries and set up in triumph upon another.</p>

<p>To understand fully the aims of pre-Raphaelitism it is necessary to recall
the character of the age which gave it birth.</p>

<p>After English art had had its beginning with the great national masters
and enjoyed a prime of real splendour, it became, about the middle of the
nineteenth century, the prey to a tedious disease. A series of crude historical
painters endeavoured to fathom the noble style of the Italian Cinquecento,
without rising above the level of intelligent plagiarism. As brilliant decorative
artists possessed of pomp and majesty, and sensuously affected by plastic
beauty, as worshippers of the nude human form, and as modern Greeks, the
Italian classic painters were the worst conceivable guides for a people who in
every artistic achievement have pursued spiritual expression in preference to
plastic beauty. But in spite of the experiences gained since the time of
Hogarth, they all went on the pilgrimage to Rome, as to a sacred spring,
drank their fill in long draughts, and came back poisoned. Even Wilkie, that
charming &ldquo;little master,&rdquo; who did the work of a pioneer so long as he followed
the congenial Flemish painters and the Dutch, even Wilkie lost every trace
of individuality after seeing Spain and Italy. As this imitation of the high
Renaissance period led to forced and affected sentiment, it also developed an
empty academical technique. In accordance with the precepts of the Cinquecento,
artists proceeded with an affected ease to make brief work of everything,
contenting themselves with a superficial <i>façade</i> effect. A painting based
on dexterity of hand took the place of the religious study of nature, and a
banal arrangement after celebrated models took the place of inward absorption.</p>

<p>It was to no purpose that certain painters, such as <i>F. C. Horsley</i>, <i>J. R.
Herbert</i>, <i>J. Tenniel</i>, <i>Edwin Long</i>, <i>E. M. Ward</i>, and <i>Eastlake</i>, the English Piloty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span>
by imitation of the Flemish and Venetian masters, made more of a return
from idealism of form to colour, and that <i>Edwin Armitage</i>, who had studied
in Paris and Munich, introduced Continental influences. They are the Delaroche,
Gallait, and Bièfve of England. Their art was an imposing scene
painting, their programme always that of the school of Bologna&mdash;the mother
of all academies, great and small&mdash;borrowing drawing from Michael Angelo
and colour from Titian; taking the best from every one, putting it all into a
pot, and shaking it together. Thus English art lost the peculiar national
stamp which it had had under Reynolds and Gainsborough, Constable and
Turner. It became an insignificant tributary of the false art which then held
sway over the Continent, insincere towards nature, full of empty rhetorical
passion, and bound to the most vacant routine. And as the grand painting
became hollow and mannered, <i>genre</i> painting grew Philistine and decrepit.
Its innocent childishness and conventional optimism had led to a tedious
anecdotic painting. It repeated, like a talkative old man, the most insipid
tales, and did so with a complacency that never wavered and with an
unpleasant motley of colour. The English school still existed in landscape,
but for everything else it was dead.</p>

<p>A need for reform became urgent all the sooner because literature too
had diverged into new lines. In poetry there was the influence of the Lake
poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, who had simplicity, direct feeling for nature,
and a Rousseau-like pantheism inscribed as a device upon their banner, and
it came as a reaction against the dazzling imaginative fervour of those great
and forceful men of genius Byron and Shelley. Keats had again uttered the
phrase which had before been Shaftesbury&rsquo;s gospel: &ldquo;Beauty is truth, truth
beauty.&rdquo; In the year 1843 John Ruskin published the first volume of his
<i>Modern Painters</i>, the æsthetic creed of which culminated in the tenet that
nature alone could be the source of all true art.</p>

<p>This transitional spirit, which strove for liberty from the academical yoke,
though diffidently at first, is represented in painting by the Scotch artist
<i>William Dyce</i>. In England he pursued, though undoubtedly with greater
ability, a course parallel to that of the German Nazarenes, whose faith he
championed. Born in 1806, he had in Italy, in the year 1826, made the
acquaintance of Overbeck, who won him over to Perugino and Raphael.
Protesting against the histrionic emptiness of English historical painting, he
took refuge with the Quattrocentisti and the young Raphael. His masterpiece,
the Westminster frescoes, with the Arthurian legends as their subject,
goes to some extent on parallel lines with Schnorr&rsquo;s frescoes on the Nibelungen
myths. The representation of vigorous manhood and tempestuous heroism
has been here attempted without sentimentality or theatrical heroics. In
his oil pictures&mdash;Madonnas, &ldquo;Bacchus nursed by the Nymphs,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Woman
of Samaria,&rdquo; &ldquo;Christ in Gethsemane,&rdquo; &ldquo;St. John leading Home the Virgin,&rdquo;
etc.&mdash;he makes a surprising effect by the graceful, sensuous charm of his women,
by his exquisite landscapes and his tender idyllic characters. The charming

work &ldquo;Jacob and Rachel,&rdquo; which represents him in the Hamburg Kunsthalle,
might be ascribed to Führich, except that the developed feeling for colour
bears witness to its English origin. With yearning the youth hastens to the
maiden, who stands, leaning against the edge of the well, with her eyes cast
down, half repulsing him in her austere chastity.</p>

<p>Where the Nazarenes obtain a pallid, corpse-like effect, a deep and luminous
quality of colour delights one in his pictures. He is essentially graceful, and
with this grace he combines the pure and quiet simplicity of the Umbrian
masters. There is something touching in certain of his Madonnas, who,
in long, clinging raiment, appeal to the Godhead with arms half lifted, devout
lips parted in prayer, and mild glances lost in infinity. A dreamy loveliness
brings the heavenly figures nearer to us. Dyce expresses the magic of downcast
lids with long, dark lashes. Like the Umbrians, he delights in the
elasticity of slender limbs and the chaste grace of blossoming maiden beauty.
Many German fresco painters have become celebrated who never achieved
anything equal in artistic merit to the Westminster pictures of Dyce. Yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>6</span>
he is to be reckoned with the Flandrin-Overbeck family, since he gives a
repetition of the young Raphael, though he certainly does it well; but he
only imitates and has not improved upon him.</p>

<p>The pictures of another Scotchman, <i>Sir Joseph Noël Paton</i>, born in 1821,
appear at a rather later date. Most of them&mdash;&ldquo;The Quarrel of Oberon
and Titania,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Reconciliation of Oberon and Titania&rdquo; in the Edinburgh
Gallery, and his masterpiece, &ldquo;The Fairy Queen&rdquo;&mdash;have, from the æsthetic
standpoint, little enjoyment to offer. The drawing is hard, the composition
overladen, the colour scattered and motley. As in Ary Scheffer, all the
figures have vapid, widely opened eyes. Elves, gnomes, women, knights,
and fantastic rocks are crowded so tightly together that the frame scarcely
holds them. But the loving study of nature in the separate parts is extraordinary.
It is possible to give a botanical definition of each plant and each
flower in the foreground, with so much character and such care has Paton
executed every leaf and every blossom, even the tiny creeping things amid
the meadow grass. Here and there a fresh ray of morning sun breaks through
the light green and leaps from blade to blade. The landscapes of Albrecht
Altdorfer are recalled to mind. Emancipation from empty, heroically impassioned
emphasis, pantheistic adoration of nature, even a certain effort&mdash;unsuccessful
indeed&mdash;after an independent sentiment for colour, are what
his pictures seem to preach in their naïve angularity, their loving execution
of detail, and their bright green motley.</p>

<p>This was the mood of the young artists who united to form the pre-Raphaelite
group of 1848. They were students at the Royal Academy of
from twenty to four-and-twenty years of age. The first of the group, Dante
Gabriel Rossetti, had already written some of his poems. The second,
Holman Hunt, had still a difficulty in overcoming the opposition of his father,
who was not pleased to see him giving up a commercial career. John Everett
Millais, the youngest, had made most progress as a painter, and was one of
the best pupils at the Academy. But they were contented neither by the
artistic achievement of their teachers nor by the method of instruction. Etty,
the most valued of them all, according to the account of Holman Hunt,
painted mythological pictures, full of empty affectation; Mulready drew in
a diluted fashion, and sacrificed everything to elegance; Maclise had fallen
into patriotic banalities; Dyce had stopped short in his course and begun
again when it was too late. Thus they had of necessity to provide their
own training for themselves. All three worked in the same studio; and it
so happened that one day&mdash;in 1847 or 1848&mdash;chance threw into their hands
some engravings of Benozzo Gozzoli&rsquo;s Campo-Santo frescoes in Pisa. Nature
and truth&mdash;everything which they had dimly surmised, and had missed in
the productions of English art&mdash;here they were. Overcome with admiration
for the sparkling life, the intensity of feeling, and the vigorous form of these
works, which did not even shrink from the consequences of ugliness, they
were agreed in recognising that art had always stood on the basis of nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>7</span>
until the end of the fifteenth century, or, more exactly, until the year 1508,
when Raphael left Florence to paint in the Vatican in Rome. Since then
everything had gone wrong; art had stripped off the simple garment of natural
truthfulness and fallen into conventional phrases, which in the course of
centuries had become more and more empty and repellent by vapid repetition.
Was it necessary that the persons in pictures should, to the end of
the world, stand and move just as they had done a thousand times in the
works of the Cinquecentisti? Was it necessary that human emotions&mdash;love,
boldness, remorse, and renunciation&mdash;should always be expressed by
the same turn of the head, the same lift of the eyebrows, the same gesture
of the arms, and the same folded hands, which came into vogue through the
Cinquecentisti? Where in nature are the rounded forms which Raphael,
the first Classicist, borrowed from the antique? And in the critical moments
of life do people really form themselves into such carefully balanced groups,
with the one who chances to have on the finest clothes in the centre?</p>

<p>From this reaction against the Cinquecentisti and against the shallow
imitation of them, the title pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and the secret,
masonic sign P.R.B., which they added to their signatures upon their pictures,
are rendered comprehensible. But whilst Dyce, to avoid the Cinquecentisti,
imitated the Quattrocentisti, the title here is only meant to signify that these
artists, like the Quattrocentisti, had determined to go back to the original
source of real life. The Academy pupils Rossetti, Millais, and Holman Hunt,
together with the young sculptor Thomas Woolner, who had just left school,
were at first the only members of the Brotherhood. Later the <i>genre</i> painter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>
James Collinson, the painter and critic F. G. Stephens, and Rossetti&rsquo;s brother,
William Michael Rossetti, were admitted to the alliance.</p>

<p>Boldly they declared war against all conventional rules, described themselves
as beginners and their pictures as attempts, and announced themselves
to be, at any rate, sincere. The programme of their school was truth; not
imitation of the old masters, but strict and keen study of nature such as the old
masters had practised themselves. They were in reaction against the superficial
dexterity of technique and the beauty of form and intellectual emptiness
to which the English historical picture had fallen victim; they were in reaction
against the trivial banality which disfigured English <i>genre</i> painting. In the
representation of passion the true gestures of nature were to be rendered,
without regard to grace and elegance, and without the stock properties of
pantomime. The end for which they strove was to be true and not to create
what was essentially untrue by a borrowed idealism which had an appearance
of being sublime. In opposition to the negligent painting of the artists of
their age, they demanded slavishly faithful imitation of the model by detail,
carried out with microscopic exactness. Nothing was to be done without
reverence for nature; every part of a picture down to the smallest blade or
leaf was to be directly painted from the original. Even at the expense of total
effect every picture was to be carried out in minutest detail. It was better
to stammer than to make empty phrases. A young and vigorous art, such as
had been in the fifteenth century, could win its way, as they believed, from
this conception alone.</p>

<p>In all these points, in the revolt against the emptiness of the <i>beauté suprême</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span>
and the flowing lines of the accepted routine of composition, they were at one
with Courbet and Millet. It was only in further developments that the
French and English parted company; English realism received a specifically
English tinge. Since every form of Classicism&mdash;for to this point they were
led by the train of their ideas&mdash;declares the ideal completion of form, of
physical presentment, to be its highest aim, the standard-bearers of realism
were obliged to seek the highest aim of their art, founded exclusively on the
study of nature, in the representation of moral and intellectual life, in a thoughtful
form of spiritual creation. The blending of realism with profundity of
ideas, of uncompromising truth to nature in form with philosophic and poetic
substance, is of the very essence of the pre-Raphaelites. They are transcendental
naturalists, equally widely removed from Classicism, which deals only
with beautiful bodies, as from realism
proper, which only proposes to represent
a fragment of nature. From opposition
to abstract beauty of form they insist
upon what is characteristic, energetic,
angular; but their figures painted faithfully
from nature are the vehicles of
a metaphysical idea. From the first
they saturated themselves with poetry.
Holman Hunt has an enthusiasm for
Keats and the Bible, Rossetti for
Dante, Millais for the mediæval poems
of chivalry.</p>

<p>All three appeared before the public
for the first time in the year 1849.
John Millais and Holman Hunt exhibited
in the Royal Academy, the one
being represented by his &ldquo;Lorenzo and
Isabella,&rdquo; a subject drawn from Keats,
the other by his &ldquo;Rienzi.&rdquo; Rossetti
had his picture, &ldquo;The Girlhood of Mary
Virgin,&rdquo; exhibited at the Free Exhibition,
afterwards known as the Portland
Gallery. All three works excited attention
and also derision, and much
shaking of heads. The three next
works of 1850&mdash;&ldquo;A Converted British
Family sheltering a Christian Missionary,&rdquo;
by Holman Hunt; &ldquo;The Child
Jesus in the Workshop of Joseph the
Carpenter,&rdquo; by Millais; and &ldquo;The
Annunciation&rdquo; by Rossetti&mdash;were received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span>
with the same amused contempt. When they exhibited for the
third time&mdash;Holman Hunt, a scene from <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>;
Millais, &ldquo;The Return of the Dove to the Ark&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Woodman&rsquo;s
Daughter&rdquo;&mdash;such a storm of excitement broke forth that the pictures had
to be removed from the exhibition. A furious article appeared in <i>The Art
Journal</i>; the exhibitors, it was said, were certainly young, but they were
too old to commit such sins of youth. Even Dickens turned against
them in <i>Household Words</i>. The painters who had been assailed made their
answer. William Michael Rossetti laid down the principles of the Brotherhood
by an article in a periodical called <i>The Critic</i>, and smuggled a second
article into <i>The Spectator</i>. In 1850 they founded a monthly magazine for
the defence of their theories, <i>The Germ</i>, which on the third number took the
title <i>Art and Poetry</i>, and was most charmingly embellished with drawings by
Holman Hunt, Madox Brown, and others. Stephens published an essay in it,
on the ways and aims of the early Italians, which gave him occasion to discuss
the works recently produced in the spirit of simplicity known to these old
masters. Madox Brown wrote a paper on historical painting, in which he
asserted that the true basis of historical painting must be strict fidelity to
the model, to the exclusion of all generalisation and beautifying, and exact
antiquarian study of costumes
and furniture in contradistinction
to the fancy
history of the elder painters.
But all these articles were written
to no purpose. After the
fourth number the magazine
was stopped, and in these
days it has become a curiosity
for bibliomaniacs. But
support came from another
side. Holman Hunt&rsquo;s picture
dealing with a scene from
Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Two Gentlemen
of Verona</i> received the most
trenchant condemnation in
<i>The Times</i>. John Ruskin
came forward as his champion
and replied on 13th
May 1851. <i>The Times</i> contained
yet a second letter
from him on 30th May. And
soon afterwards both were
issued as a pamphlet, with
the title <i>Pre-Raphaelitism</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>
<i>its Principles, and Turner</i>. These works, he said, did not imitate old pictures,
but nature; what alienated the public in them was their truth and rightness,
which had broken abruptly and successfully with the conventional
sweep of lines.</p>

<p><i>Holman Hunt</i> is the painter who has been most consistent in clinging
throughout his life to these original principles of the Brotherhood. He is
distinguished by a depth of thought which at last tends to become entirely
elusive, and often a depth of spirit more profound than diver ever plumbed;
but at the same time by an angular, gnarled realism which has scarcely its
equal in all the European art of the century.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Flight of Madeleine and Porphyro,&rdquo; from Keats&rsquo; <i>Eve of St. Agnes</i>,
was the first picture, the subject being borrowed in 1848 from his favourite
poet. In the work through which he first acknowledged himself a member
of the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood he has given a plain and simple rendering
of the scene in the introductory chapter of Bulwer Lytton&rsquo;s <i>Rienzi</i>. He has
chosen the moment when Rienzi, kneeling beside the corpse of his brother,
takes a vow of vengeance against the murderer who is riding away. The
composition avoids any kind of conventional pyramidal structure. In the
foreground every flower is painted and every colour is frankly set beside its
neighbour without the traditional gradation. His third picture, &ldquo;A Converted
British Family sheltering a Christian Missionary,&rdquo; is not to be reckoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>
amongst his best performances. It is forced naïveté, suggesting the old
masters, to unite two entirely different scenes upon the same canvas: in the
background there are fugitives and pursuers, and a Druid, merely visible by
his outstretched arms, inciting the populace to the murder of a missionary;
in the foreground a hut open on all sides, which could really offer no protection
at all. Yet in this hut a priest is hiding, tended by converted Britons. However,
the drawing of the nude bodies is an admirable piece of realism; admirable,
also, is the way in which he has expressed the fear of the inmates, and
the fanatical bloodthirsty rage of the pursuers, and this without any false
heroics, without any rhetoric based upon the traditional language of gesture.
The picture from Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, with the motto,
&ldquo;Death is a fearful thing, and shamed life a hateful,&rdquo; is perhaps theatrical
in its arrangement, though it is likewise earnest and convincing in psychological
expression.</p>

<p>Microscopic fidelity to nature, which formed the first principle in the programme
of the Brotherhood, has been carried in Holman Hunt to the highest
possible point. Every flower and every ear of corn, every feather and every
blade of grass, every fragment of bark on the trees and every muscle, is painted
with scrupulous accuracy. The joke made about the pre-Raphaelites has
reference to Holman Hunt: it was said that when they had to paint a landscape
they used to bring to their studio a blade of grass, a leaf, and a piece of
bark, and they multiplied them microscopically so many thousand times
until the landscape was finished. His works are a triumph of industry, and
for that very reason they are not a pleasure to the eye. A petty, pedantic
fidelity to nature injures the total effect, and the hard colours&mdash;pungent
green, vivid yellow, glaring blue, and glowing red&mdash;which Holman Hunt
places immediately beside each other, give his pictures something brusque,
barbaric, and jarring. But as a reaction against a system of painting by
routine, which had become mannered, such truth without all compromise,
such painstaking effort at the utmost possible fidelity to nature, was, in its
very harshness, of epoch-making significance.</p>

<p>With regard, also, to the transcendental purport of his pictures Holman
Hunt is perhaps the most genuine of the group. In the whole history of art
there are no religious pictures in which uncompromising naturalism has made
so remarkable an alliance with a pietistic depth of ideas. The first, which
he sent to the exhibition of 1854, &ldquo;The Light of the World,&rdquo; represents Christ
wandering through the night in a gold-embroidered mantle, with a lantern
in His hand, like a Divine Diogenes seeking men. Taine, who studied the
picture impartially without the catalogue, describes it, without further addition,
as &ldquo;Christ by night with a lantern.&rdquo; But for Holman Hunt the meaning
is Christianity illuminating the universe with the mystic light of Faith and
seeking admission at the long-closed door of unbelief. It was because of
this implicit suggestion that the work made an indescribable sensation in
England; it had to go on pilgrimage from town to town, and hundreds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span>
thousands of copies of the engraving were sold. The pietistic feeling of this
ascetic preacher was so strong that he was able to venture on pictures like
&ldquo;The Scapegoat&rdquo; of 1856 without becoming comical.</p>

<p>A striving to attain the greatest possible local truth had led Holman Hunt
to the East when he began these biblical pictures. He spent several years
in Palestine studying the topographical character of the land, its buildings
and its people, and endeavoured with the help of these actual men and women
and these landscape scenes to reconstruct the events of biblical history with
antiquarian fidelity. To paint &ldquo;The Shadow of Death&rdquo; he searched in the
East until he discovered a Jew who corresponded to his idea of Christ, and
painted him, a strong, powerful man, the genuine son of a carpenter, with that
astounding truth to nature with which Hubert van Eyck painted his Adam.
Even the hairs of the breast and legs are as faithfully rendered as if one saw
the model in a glass. Near this naked carpenter&mdash;for He is clothed only with
a leather apron&mdash;there kneels a modern Eastern woman, bowed over a chest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>
in which various Oriental vessels are lying. The ground is covered with
shavings of wood. Up to this point, therefore, it is a naturalistic picture
from the modern East. But here Holman Hunt&rsquo;s pietistic sentiment is seen:
it is the eve of a festival; the sun casts its last dying rays into the room;
the journeyman carpenter wearily stretches out His arms, and the shadow
of His body describes upon the wall the prophetic form of the Cross.</p>

<p>Another picture represented the discovery of our Lord in the Temple, a
third the flock which has been astray following the Good Shepherd into His
Father&rsquo;s fold. On his picture of the flight into Egypt, or, as he has himself
called it, &ldquo;The Triumph of the Innocents,&rdquo; he published a pamphlet of twelve
pages, in which he goes into all the historical events connected with the picture
with the loyalty of an historian; he discusses everything&mdash;in what month
the flight took place, and by what route, how old Christ was, to what race
the ass belonged, and what clothes were worn by Saint Joseph and Mary.
One might be forgiven for thinking such a production the absurd effusion of
a whimsical pedant were it not that Hunt is so grimly in earnest in everything
he does. In spite of all his peculiarities it must be admitted that he gave a
deep and earnest religious character to English art, which before his time had
been so paltry; and this explains the powerful impression which he made
upon his contemporaries.</p>

<p>The artist most closely allied to him in technique is <i>Ford Madox Brown</i>,
who did not reckon himself officially with the pre-Raphaelites, though he
followed the same principles in what concerned the treatment of detail. Only
a little senior to the founders of the Brotherhood&mdash;he was nine-and-twenty at
the time&mdash;he is to be regarded as their more mature ally and forerunner.
Rossetti was under no illusion when, in the beginning of his studies, he turned
to him directly. In those years Madox Brown was the only English painter
who was not addicted to the trivialities of paltry <i>genre</i> painting or the theatrical
heroics of traditional history. He is a bold artist, with a gift of dramatic
force and a very rare capacity of concentration,
and these qualities hindered him from
following the doctrine of the pre-Raphaelites
in all its consequences. If he had, in accordance
with their programme, exclusively
confined himself to work from the living
model, several of his most striking and powerful
pictures would never have been painted.</p>

<p>Madox Brown passed his youth on the
Continent&mdash;in Antwerp with Wappers, in
Paris, and in Rome. The pictures which he
painted there in the beginning of the forties
were produced, as regards technique, under
the influence of Wappers. The subjects
were taken from Byron: &ldquo;The Sleep of
Parisina&rdquo; and &ldquo;Manfred on the Jungfrau.&rdquo; It is only in the latter that an
independent initiative is perceptible. In contradistinction from the generalities
of the school of Wappers he aimed at greater depth of psychology and
accuracy of costume, while at the same time he endeavoured, though without
success, to replace the conventional studio light by the carefully observed
effect of free light. These three things&mdash;truth of colour, of spiritual expression,
and of historical character&mdash;were from this time forth his principal care. And
when his cartoon of &ldquo;Harold,&rdquo; painted in Paris in the year 1844, was exhibited
in Westminster Hall, it was chiefly this scrupulous effort at truth
which made such a vivid impression upon the younger generation. In the
first masterpiece which he painted after his return to London in 1848 he
stands out already in all his rugged individuality. &ldquo;Lear and Cordelia,&rdquo;
founded on a most tragic passage in the most tragic of the great dramas of
Shakespeare, is here treated with impressive cogency. It stood in such abrupt
opposition to the traditional historical painting that perhaps nothing was
ever so sharply opposed to anything so universally accepted. The figures
stand out stiff and parti-coloured like card kings, without fluency of line or
rounded and generalised beauty. And the colouring is just as incoherent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
The brown sauce, which every one had hitherto respected like a binding social
law, had given way to a bright joy of colour, the half-barbaric motley which one
finds in old miniatures. It is only when one studies the brilliant details, used
merely in the service of a great psychological effect, that this outwardly repellent
picture takes shape as a powerful work of art, a work of profound
human truth. Nothing is sacrificed to pose, graceful show, or histrionic
affectation. Like the German masters of the fifteenth century, Madox Brown
makes no attempt to dilute what is ugly, nor did Holbein either when he
painted the leprous beggars in his &ldquo;Altar to St. Sebastian.&rdquo; Every figure,
whether fair or foul, is, in bearing, expression, and gesture, a character of
robust and rigorous hardihood, and has that intense fulness of life which is
compressed in those carved wooden figures of mediæval altars: the aged Lear
with his weather-beaten face and his waving beard; the envious Regan;
the cold, cruel, ambitious Goneril; Albany, with his fair, inexpressive head;
the gross, brutal Cornwall; Burgundy, biting his nails in indecision; and
Cordelia, in her touching, bashful grace. And to this angular frankness of
the primitive masters he unites the profound learning of the modern historian.
All the archæological details, the old British costumes, jewels, modes of
wearing the hair, weapons, furniture,
and hangings, have been
studied with the accuracy of
Menzel. He knows nothing of
the academic rules of composition,
and his robes fall naturally
without the petty appendage of
fair folds and graceful motives.</p>

<p>The picture in which he treated
the balcony scene in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> is outwardly repellent,
like &ldquo;Lear and Cordelia,&rdquo;
but what a hollow effect is made
by Makart&rsquo;s theatrical heroics
beside this aboriginal sensuousness,
this intensity of expression!
Juliet&rsquo;s dress has fallen from her
shoulders, and, devoid of will and
thought, with closed lids, half-naked,
and thrilling in every fibre
with the lingering joy of the hours
that have passed, she abandons
herself to the last fiery embraces
of Romeo, who in stormy haste
is feeling with one foot for the
ladder of ropes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span></p>

<p>He has solved a yet more
difficult problem in the picture
&ldquo;Elijah and the Widow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, thy son liveth,&rdquo; are
the words in the Bible with
which the hoary Elijah brings
the boy, raised from death
and still enveloped in his
shroud, to the agonised
mother kneeling at the foot
of the sepulchre. The woman
makes answer: &ldquo;Now by
this I know that thou art a
man of God.&rdquo; In the embodiment
of this scene likewise
Madox Brown has
aimed in costume and accessories
at a complete harmony
between the figures
and the character of the
epoch, and has set out with
an entirely accurate study
of Assyrian and Egyptian
monuments. Even the inscription
on the wall and the
Egyptian antiquities correspond
to ancient originals.
At the same time the figures
have been given the breath of new life. Elijah looks more like a wild aboriginal
man than a saint of the Cinquecento. The ecstasy of the mother, the astonishment
of the child whose great eyes, still unaccustomed to the light, gaze into
the world again with a dreamy effort, after having beheld the mysteries
of death&mdash;these are things depicted with an astonishing power. The
downright but convincing method in which Hogarth paints the soul has
dislodged the hollow, heroical ideal of beauty of the older historical painting.
Madox Brown&rsquo;s confession of faith, which he formulated as an author, culminates
in the tenet that truth is the means of art, its end being the quickening
of the soul. This he expresses in two words: &ldquo;emotional truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Holman Hunt and Madox Brown held fast throughout their lives
to the pre-Raphaelite principles, pre-Raphaelitism was for <i>John Everett
Millais</i>, the youngest of the three, merely a transitory phase, a stage in his
artistic development.</p>

<p>Sir John Millais was born 8th June 1829, in Southampton, where his
family had come from Jersey. Thus he is half a Frenchman by descent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
His childhood was passed in Dinant in Brittany, but when he was nine years
old he went to a London school of drawing. He was then the little fair-haired
boy in a holland blouse, a broad sash, and a large sailor&rsquo;s collar, whom John
Phillip painted in those days. When eleven he entered the Royal Academy,
probably being the youngest pupil there; at thirteen he won a prize medal
for the best drawing from the antique; at fifteen he was already painting;
and at seventeen he exhibited an historical picture, &ldquo;Pizarro seizing the Inca
of Peru,&rdquo; which was praised by the critics as the best in the exhibition of 1846.
With &ldquo;Elgiva,&rdquo; a work exhibited in 1847, this first period, in which he followed
the lines of the now forgotten painter Hilton, was brought to an end. His
next work, &ldquo;Lorenzo and Isabella,&rdquo; now in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool,
bore the letters P.R.B., as a sign of his new confession of faith. Microscopically
exact work in detail has taken the place of the large bravura and
the empty imitation of the Cinquecentisti. The theme was borrowed from
one of Boccaccio&rsquo;s tales, <i>The Pot of Basil</i>&mdash;the tale on which Keats founded
<i>Isabella</i>. A company of Florentines in the costume of the thirteenth century
are assembled at dinner. Lorenzo, pale and in suppressed excitement, sits
beside the lovely Isabella, looking at her with a glance of deep, consuming
passion. Isabella&rsquo;s brother, angered at it, gives a kick to her dog. All the
persons at the table are likenesses. The critic F. G. Stephens sat for the
beloved of Isabella, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti for the toper holding his
glass to his lips at the far right of the table. Even the ornaments upon the
damask cloth, the screen, and the tapestry in the background are painted,
stroke after stroke, with the conscientious
devotion of a primitive
painter. Jan van Eyck&rsquo;s brilliancy
of colour is united to Perugino&rsquo;s
suavity of feeling, and the chivalrous
spirit of the <i>Decameron</i> seized with
the sureness of a subtle literary
scholar.</p>

<p>The work of 1850, &ldquo;The Child
Jesus in the Workshop of Joseph the
Carpenter,&rdquo; illustrated a verse in
the Bible (Zechariah xiii. 6): &ldquo;And
one shall say unto Him, What are
these wounds in Thine hands?
Then He shall answer, Those with
which I was wounded in the house
of My friends.&rdquo; The Child Jesus,
who is standing before the joiner&rsquo;s
bench, has hurt Himself in the hand.
St. Joseph is leaning over to look
at the wound, and Mary is kneeling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>
beside the Child, trying to console Him with her caresses, whilst the little
St. John is bringing water in a wooden vessel. Upon the other side of the
bench stands the aged Anna, in the act of drawing out of the wood the nail
which has caused the injury. A workman is labouring busily at the joiner&rsquo;s
bench. The floor of the workshop is littered with shavings, and tools hang
round upon the walls. The Quattrocentisti were likewise the determining
influence in the treatment of this subject. Ascetic austerity has taken the
place of ideal draperies, and angularity that of the noble flow of line. The
figure of Mary, who, with her yellow kerchief, resembled the wife of a London
citizen, was the cause of special offence.</p>

<p>Up to the seventies Millais continued to paint such pictures out of the
Bible, or from English and mediæval poets, with varying success. One of
them, which in its brilliant colouring looked like an old picture upon glass,
represented the return of the dove to Noah&rsquo;s ark. The central point was
formed by two slender young women in mediæval costume, who received the
exhausted bird in their delicate hands. The picture, &ldquo;The Woodman&rsquo;s
Daughter,&rdquo; was an illustration to a poem by Coventry Patmore, on the love
of a young noble for a poor child of the wood. In a semicircular picture of
1852 he painted Ophelia as she floats singing in the green pool where the
white water-lilies cover her like mortuary wreaths&mdash;floats with her parted lips
flickering with a gentle smile of distraction. The other picture of this year,
&ldquo;The Huguenot,&rdquo; represented two lovers taking leave of each other in an
old park upon the eve of St. Bartholomew. She is winding a white scarf
round his arm to save him from death by this badge of the Catholics, whilst
he is gently resisting. The mood of the man standing before the dark gate
of death, the moral strength which vanquishes his fear, and all the solemnity
of his farewell to life are expressed in his glance. A world of love rests in the
eyes of the woman. Millais has often treated this problem of the loving
woman with earnest and almost sombre realism, that knows no touch of
swooning sentimentality. &ldquo;The Order of Release&rdquo; of 1853 shows a jailor in
the scarlet uniform of the eighteenth
century opening a heavy prison door
to set at liberty a Highlander, whose
release has been obtained by his
wife. A scene from the seventeenth
century is treated in &ldquo;The Proscribed
Royalist&rdquo;: a noble cavalier, hidden
in a hollow tree, is kissing the hand
of a graceful, trembling woman, who
has been daily bringing him food at
the risk of her life. &ldquo;The Black
Brunswicker&rdquo; of 1856 closed this
series of silent and motionless dramas.
In the picture of 1857, &ldquo;Sir Isumbras
at the Ford,&rdquo; an old knight is riding
home through the twilight of a sultry
day in June. The dust of the journey
lies upon his golden armour. At a
ford he has fallen in with two children,
and has lifted them up to carry
them over the water. And &ldquo;The
Vale of Rest,&rdquo; a picture deep and
intense in its scheme of colour,
earnest and melancholy as a requiem,
revealed&mdash;with a sentiment a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span>
like that of Lessing&mdash;a cloister garden where two nuns are silently preparing a
grave in the evening light; while &ldquo;The Eve of Saint Agnes&rdquo; in 1863 illustrated
the same poem of Keats to which ten years previously Holman Hunt had
devoted his work of early years. Madeleine has heard the old legend, telling
how girls receive the tender homage of their future husbands if they go through
their evening prayer supperless at midnight. With her heart filled with
the thoughts of love she quits the hall where the guests are seated at a merry
feast, and mounts to her room so hastily that her thin taper is extinguished
on the way. She enters her little chamber, kneels down, repeats the prayer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>28</span>
and rises to her feet, taking off her finery and loosening her hair. The clear
moonlight streams through the window, throwing a ghostly illumination over
the little images of saints in the room, falling like a caress upon the tender
young breast of the girl, playing upon her folded hands, and touching her
long, fair hair with a radiance like a vaporous glory. In the shadow of the
bed she sees him whom she loves. Motionless, as in a dream, she stands, nor
ventures to turn lest the fair vision should vanish. &ldquo;The Deliverance of a
Heretic condemned to the Stake,&rdquo; &ldquo;Joan of Arc,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cinderella,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Last
Rose,&rdquo; that dreamy picture of romantic grace, &ldquo;The Childhood of Sir Walter
Raleigh,&rdquo; and the picture of the hoary Moses, supported by Hur and Aaron,
watching from the mountain-top the victory of Joshua, were the principal
works achieved in the later years of the master. But when these pictures were
executed England had become accustomed to honour Millais, not as a pre-Raphaelite,
but as her greatest portrait painter.</p>

<p>His portrait of himself explains this transformation. With his white linen
jacket and his fresh sunburnt face Sir John Millais does not look in the least
like a &ldquo;Romanticist,&rdquo; scarcely like a painter; he has rather the air of being a
wealthy landowner. He was a man of a sound and straightforward nature,
a great and energetic master, conscious of his aim, but a poet in Ruskin&rsquo;s sense
of the word is what he has never been. His pre-Raphaelitism was only a
flirtation. His methods of thought were too concrete, his hand too powerful,
for him to have lingered always in the world of the English poets, or endured
the precise style of the pre-Raphaelites. &ldquo;Millais will &lsquo;go far&rsquo; if he will only
change his boots,&rdquo; About had written on the occasion of the World Exhibition
of 1855; when that of 1867 was opened Millais appeared in absolutely new shoes.
The great exhibition of 1857 in Manchester, which made known for the first
time how many of the works of Velasquez were hidden in English private
collections, had helped Millais to the knowledge of himself. From the naturalism
of the Quattrocentisti he made a transition to the naturalism of Velasquez.</p>

<p>Millais was a born portrait painter. His cool and yet finely sensitive nature,
his simple, manly temperament, directed him to this department, which rather
gravitates to the observant and imitative than to the creative pole of art.
In his pictures he has the secret of enchanting and of repelling; he has arrived
at really definite issues in portrait painting. His likenesses are all of them as
convincing as they are actual. Together with the Venetians and with Velasquez,
Millais belongs to the master spirits of the grand style, which relies upon
the large movement of lines, in figure and in face, upon the broad foundation
of surfaces, and the strict subordination of individual details. His figures are
characteristic and recognisable even in outline. He makes no effort to render
them interesting by picturesque attitudes, or to vivify them by placing them
in any situation. There they stand calm, and sometimes stiff and cold; they
make no attempt at conversation with the spectator, nor come out of themselves,
as it were, but fix their eyes upon him with an air of well-bred composure
and indifference. Even the hands are not made use of for characterisation.</p>

<p>The extraordinary intensity of life which sparkles in his great figures, so
simply displayed, is almost exclusively concentrated in the heads. Millais is
perhaps the first master of characterisation amongst the moderns. To bold
and powerful exposition there is united a noble and psychical gaze. The eyes
which he paints are like windows through which the soul is visible.</p>

<p>Amongst his portraits of men, those of Gladstone and Hook stand in the
first rank: as paintings perhaps they are not specially eminent; both have an
opaque, sooty tone, from which Millais&rsquo; works not unfrequently suffer, but as
a definition of complex personalities they are comparable only with the best
pictures of Lenbach. How firmly does the statesman hold himself, despite his
age, the old tree-feller, the stern idealist, a genuine English figure chiselled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
out of hard wood. The play of light centres all the interest on the fine, earnest,
and puckered features, the lofty forehead, the energetic chin, and the liquid,
thoughtful eyes. All the biography of Gladstone lies in this picture, which is
simpler and greater in intuition than that which Lenbach painted of him.
Hook, with his broad face, furrowed with wrinkles, looks like an apostle or
a fisher. Millais has looked into the heart of this man, who has in him something
rugged and faithful, massive and tender; the painter of vigorous fishermen
and vaporous sunbeams. Hook&rsquo;s landscapes have a forceful, earnest,
and well-nigh religious effect, and something patriarchal and biblical lies in his
gentle, reflective, and contemplative glance.</p>

<p>In his portrait of the Duke of Westminster, painted in 1878, Millais depicts
him in hunting dress, red coat, white corduroys, and high, flexible boots,
as he stands and buttons on his glove. The same year &ldquo;The Yeoman of the
Guard&rdquo; was exhibited in Paris&mdash;the old type of discipline and loyalty, who
sits there in his deep red uniform, with features cast in bronze, like a Velasquez
of 1878. Disraeli, Cardinal Newman, John Bright, Lord Salisbury, Charles
Waring, Sir Henry Irving, the Marquis of Lorne, and Simon Fraser are all
worthy descendants of the eminent men whom Reynolds painted a century
before. The plastic effect of the figures is increased by the vacant, neutral
ground of the picture. Like Velasquez, Millais has made use of every possible
background, from the simplest, from the nullity of an almost black or bright
surface, to richly furnished rooms and views of landscape. Sometimes it is only
indicated by a plain chair or table that the figure is standing in a room, or a
heavy crimson curtain falls to serve as a <i>repoussoir</i> for the head. With a noble
abstention he avoids prettiness of line and insipid motives, and remains true
to this virile taste even in his portraits of women. His women have curiously
little of the æsthetical trait which runs elsewhere through English portraits
of ladies. Millais renders them&mdash;as in the picture &ldquo;Dummy Whist&rdquo;&mdash;neither
sweet nor tender, gives them nothing arch, sprightly, nor triumphant.
Severe and sculptural in their mien, and full of character rather than beauty,
proud in bearing and upright in pose, their serious, energetic features betray
decision of character; and the glance of their brown eyes&mdash;eyes like Juno&rsquo;s&mdash;is
indifferent and almost hard. A straight and liberal forehead, a beautifully
formed and very determined mouth, and a full, round chin complete this
impression of earnest dignity, august majesty, and chilling pride. To this
regular avoidance of every trace of available charm there is joined a strict
taste in toilette. He prefers to work with dark or subdued contrasts of colour,
and he is also fond of large-flowered silks&mdash;black with citron-yellow and black
with dark red.</p>

<p>And this same stringent painter of character commands, as few others, the
soft light brush of a painter of children. No one since Reynolds and Gainsborough
has painted with so much character as Millais the dazzling freshness
of English youth; the energetic pose of a boy&rsquo;s head or the beauty of an
English girl&mdash;a thing which stands in the world alone: the soft, glancing, silken
locks, rippling to a <i>blonde cendrée</i>, pale, delicate little faces, pouting little
mouths, and great, shining blue, dreamy, childish eyes. Sometimes they
stand in rose-coloured dresses embroidered with silver in front of a deep green
curtain, or sit reading upon a dark red carpet flowered with black. At other
times they are arrayed like the little Infantas of Velasquez, and play with a
spaniel like the Doge&rsquo;s children of Titian, or hold out with both hands an
apron full of flowers, which Millais paints with a high degree of finish. A spray
of pale red roses, chrysanthemums, or lilies stands near. One must be a great
master of characterisation to paint conscious, dignified, and earnest feminine
beauty like that of Mrs. Bischoffsheim, and at the same time that fragrant
perfume of the fresh and dewy spring of youth which breathes from Millais&rsquo;
pictures of children.</p>

<p>Millais is one of those men in the history of nineteenth-century painting
who are as forcible and healthy as they are many-sided. I do not know one
who could have developed so swiftly from a style of the most minute exactness
to one of the most powerful breadth; not one who could have united such
poetry of conception with such an enormous knowledge of human beings; not
one who could have been so like Proteus in variety&mdash;at one moment charming,
at another dreamy, at another entirely positive. In their firm structure and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>34</span>
largeness of manner his landscapes sometimes recall Théodore Rousseau. And
now the pre-Raphaelite is just a little evident in an excess of detail. He
paints every blade of grass and every small plant, though there is at the
same time a largeness in the midst of this scrupulous exactitude. He
does not merely see the isolated fact through a magnifying lens, but has eyes
that are sensitive to the poetry of the whole, and in spite of all study of
detail he sometimes reaches a total effect which is altogether impressionist.
His picture &ldquo;Chill October&rdquo; has an airy life, a grey, vibrating atmosphere,
such as only John Constable painted elsewhere.</p>

<p>Such a concrete study of nature as was made by the pre-Raphaelites of
necessity led at last to entirely realistic pictures from modern life. In their
biblical and poetic pictures they had started from the conviction that new life-blood
could only be poured into the old conventional types, which had gradually
become meaningless by tactfully drawing the models for them from popular
life. They believed, as the masters of Florence and Bruges had done before
them, that there could be no good painting without strict dependence on the
model; that it was of the utmost importance to give a poetic or legendary
figure the stamp of nature, the strong savour of individuality. All their
creations are based upon the elements of portrait painting, even when they
illustrate remote scenes from the New Testament or from mediæval poetry.
And these elements at last led them altogether to give up transposing such
figures into an alien <i>milieu</i>, and simply to paint what was offered by their own
surroundings. In this way they reached the goal which was arrived at in
French painting through Courbet and Ribot. It is due in the first place to the
pre-Raphaelites that the well-meant and moderately painted <i>genre</i> picture of
the old style, which, with its wealth of pathetic stories, was once a prime
source of supposed artistic pleasure, was finally vanquished in England, and
made way for earnest and vigorous painting,&mdash;painting which sought to make
its effect by purely artistic means, and proudly declined attempt to conceal
intrinsic weakness in &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; subject drawn from external sources. As
early as 1855 Millais exhibited a picture in the Royal Academy which Ruskin
called a truly great work containing the elements of immortality&mdash;&ldquo;The
Rescue.&rdquo; It represented a fireman who has carried three children from a
burning house and laid them in the arms of their parents. Narrative purport
was entirely renounced. The fireman was treated without sentimentality,
and in a way that suggested the cool fulfilment of a duty, and the agitation
of the parents was also rendered without any dash of melodrama. Then there
followed that masterpiece of exquisite and soft colouring, tender and moving
expression, and infinite grace, &ldquo;The Gambler&rsquo;s Wife,&rdquo; sadly taking up the
cards which have brought her misery upon her. In 1874 was painted &ldquo;The
North-West Passage,&rdquo; a sort of modern symbol of the forceful, enterprising
English people who have populated and subdued half the world from their
little island kingdom. &ldquo;There is a passage to the Pole, and England will
find it&mdash;must find it.&rdquo; These are more or less the words spoken by Trelawney,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span>
the old friend and comrade of Byron in Greece. With a chart before him
he is brooding over the plan of the North-West Passage, and upon his own
outstretched hand, which would fain hold the future in its grasp, the hand
of a youthful woman is soothingly laid, as she sits at his feet reading to him
the narrative of the last voyage of discovery. The figure of the seaman
with his white beard has a strong, sinewy life, and the broad daylight
streams through the room, filled with charts and atlases. The sea and
clear, bright sky gleam through the open window. It is a powerful and
moving picture, one of those modern creations in which the ideas of the
nineteenth century are concentrated with simplicity and a renunciation of all

<p>A few pictures of modern life which have nothing in common with the older
<i>genre</i> painting may even be found among the works of the devotionalist Holman
Hunt. &ldquo;Awakened Conscience,&rdquo; according to the explanation of the painter,
tells the story of a young woman seduced by a cruel and light-minded man,
and kept in a luxurious little country-house. They are together. Seated
at the piano he is playing the old melody &ldquo;Oft in the Stilly Night,&rdquo; and the
strains of the song recall to the frail maiden her youth, and the years of purity
and innocence. Thus even Hunt has not overcome the moralising tendencies
of Hogarth, though his taste is more discreet and delicate. He has struck
deeper chords of thought than the English public had heard before. And in
particular the painting is not a mere substratum for the story; it has become
the principal thing, and the story subsidiary. In another picture, &ldquo;May
Morning on Magdalen Tower,&rdquo; he renounced all deeper purpose altogether,
and merely painted a number of Oxford dons and students, who, in accordance
with the old custom, usher in the May with a hymn from the college tower.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable work of this description has been executed by
Madox Brown, the English Menzel, who has not merely reconstructed the
environment of past ages with the accuracy of an eye-witness, but has looked
upon the drama of modern life as an attentive observer. His first picture,
&ldquo;The Last of England,&rdquo; was executed in the June of 1852, at a time when
emigration to America began to take serious proportions. A married couple,
humble, middle-class people, are sitting on the deck of a ship. The man, in his
thick cloth overcoat, with a soft felt hat on his head, a pale face, and sunken
eyes with dark rings underneath, casts one more look upon his native-land,
which vanishes in the hazy distance, as he thinks bitterly of lost hopes and
vain struggles. But the young wife, in a light-coloured cloak and a pretty
round bonnet with wide strings, gazes before her with gentle resignation,
from underneath a great umbrella protecting her from the boisterous sea-wind.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;Work,&rdquo; begun at the same period, and finished, after various interruptions,
in 1865, he has produced the first modern picture of artisans after
Courbet&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stone-breakers.&rdquo; The painter, who was then living in Hampstead,
where extensive cuttings were being made for the laying down of
gas-pipes, daily saw the English artisan at labour in all his thick-set
strength. This gave him the theme for his picture. In bright daylight
on a glaring summer afternoon artisans are digging a trench for gas-pipes in
a busy street. Women and poor children are standing near. Even the
older <i>genre</i> artists had painted men in their working blouses, but only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span>
joking and making merry,
never at work. Like stage-managers
who are sure of
their public, they always set
the same troop of puppets
dancing. Madox Brown&rsquo;s
artisans are robust and raw-boned
figures; where the
older artists affected to be
witty with their <i>genre</i> painting,
Madox Brown painted
straightforwardly, without
humour and without making
his figures beautiful. The
composition of his pictures
is just as plain. No one
poses, no one makes impassioned
gestures, no one
thinks of grouping himself
with his neighbour in fine
flowing lines. It is pleasant
to think that this powerful
symbol of work has passed
by presentation into the possession
of one of the greatest
manufacturing towns in England, into the gallery of Manchester.</p>

<p>A Scotchman, born in Aberdeen, <i>John Phillip</i> was the vigorous abettor of
the pre-Raphaelites in these realistic endeavours. He, too, was a painter in
the full meaning of the word, and he has therefore left works with which the
future will have to reckon. Velasquez had opened his eyes as he had opened
those of Millais. When Phillip went to Spain in 1851, he was not the first who
had trod the Museo del Prado. Wilkie had painted in Spain before him, and
Ansdell had been busy there at the same time. But no one had been able to
grasp in any degree the impressive majesty of the old Spanish painters. John
Phillip alone gained something of the <i>verve</i> of Velasquez, a broad, virile
technique which distinguishes him from all his English contemporaries. The
impression received from his pictures is one of opulence, depth, and weight;
they unite something of the strength of Velasquez to a more Venetian splendour
of colour. The streets of Seville, the Spanish port on the Guadalquivir, the
town where Velasquez and Murillo were born, were his chief field of study.
Here he saw those market-women, black as mulattoes and sturdy as grenadiers,
who sit in front of their fruit-baskets under a great umbrella, and those water-carriers
with sunburnt visages, strongly built chests, and athletic arms.</p>

<p>After he had returned to Scotland he occasionally painted pictures of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span>
ceremonies, &ldquo;The House of Commons,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Wedding of the Princess Royal,&rdquo;
and so forth, but he soon returned to subjects from Spanish life. Gipsy-looking,
cigarette-smoking women, with sparkling eyes and jet-black hair,
young folks dancing to the castanets, bull-fighters with glittering silver-grey
costume and flashing glances, dark-brown peasants in citron-yellow petticoats,
hollow-eyed manufactory girls, potters, and glass-blowers.&mdash;such are the
materials of Phillip&rsquo;s pictures. They give no scope to anecdote; but they
always reveal a fragment of reality which emits a world of impressions and
an opulence of artistic ability. As painter <i>par excellence</i>, John Phillip stands
in opposition to older English <i>genre</i> painters. Whilst they were, in the first
place, at pains to tell a story intelligibly, Phillip was a colourist, a <i>maître
peintre</i>, whose figures were developed from the colours, and whose creations
are so full of character that they will always assert their place with the best
that has ever been painted. Even in England, the country of literary and
narrative painting, art was no longer an instrument for expressing ideas; it
had become an end in itself, and had discovered colour as its prime and
most essential medium of expression.</p>

<p class="center chap2">REALISM IN GERMANY</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">In</span> Germany the realistic movement was carried out in much the same
way as in France, though it came into action two decades after its
French original. Here also it was recognised that the well-meant but badly
painted anecdote must give way to the well-painted picture: and if we
inquire who it was that gave to Germany the first serious paintings inspired by
the modern spirit the reply, without hesitation, must be Adolf Menzel. The
pioneering work of this great little man, who for fifty years had embodied
in their typical perfection all phases of German art, is something fabulous:
the greatest and, one might almost say, the only historical painter of bygone
epochs, the only one who knew a previous period so intimately that he could
venture on painting it, was also the leader of the great movement which, in
the seventies, aimed at the representation of our own life. His first appearance
was in the time when the proud Titan Cornelius sought to take heaven
by storm. Little Menzel was no Titan in those days; he seems in that
generation like one bound to the earth, yet he belonged to the Cyclopean
race. He was a mighty architect with the powers of a giant; and this uncouth
Cyclops rough-hewed and chiselled the blocks, and, fitting each in its
place, raised an edifice to as lofty a height as the Romanticists had reached
on the perilous wings of Icarus. Having been first the draughtsman and
then the painter of Frederick the Great, he gave up history after finishing the
picture of the Battle of Hochkirch: his talent was too modern, too much set
upon what was concrete, to admit of its being given full scope to the end by
constructive work from a <i>milieu</i> that was not his own. Until his fortieth year
he had celebrated the glorious past of his country. When, with the death of
Friedrich Wilhelm IV, a great and decisive turn was given to the politics of
the Prussian state&mdash;one which put an end to the stagnation of civil life in
Prussia and Germany, and ushered in a new and brilliant period for the realm
and the heirs of Friedrich&mdash;the painter of Friedrich the Great became the
painter of the new realm. After he had already, in the first half of the century,
placed reality on the throne of art in the place of rhetoric and a vague ideal,
he went one step further in the direction of keen and direct observation, and
now painted what he saw around him&mdash;the stream of palpitating life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Coronation of King Wilhelm at Königsberg&rdquo; is the great and triumphant
title-page to this section of his art. The effects of light, the red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
tones of the uniforms, the shimmering white silk dresses, the surging of the
mass of people, the perfect ease with which all the personages are individualised,
the princes, the ministers, the ambassadors, the men of learning, the instantaneousness
in the movement of the figures, the absolutely unforced and yet
subtle and pictorial composition, render this painting no picture of ceremonies,
in the traditional sense of the phrase, but a work of art at once intimate
and august in the impression which it makes. In the picture &ldquo;King
Wilhelm setting out to join the Army&rdquo;&mdash;the representation of the thrilling
moment, on the afternoon of 31st July 1870, when the King drove along the
linden avenue to the railway station&mdash;this phase, which he began with the
Coronation picture, was brought to a close. Everything surges and moves,
speaks and breathes, and glows with the palpitating life which vibrates
through all in this moment of patriotic excitement. But the painter&rsquo;s course
led him further.</p>

<p>He first became entirely Menzel when he made the discovery of toiling
humanity. In 1867, in the year of the World Exhibition, he came to Paris
and became acquainted with Meissonier and Stevens. With Meissonier in
particular&mdash;whose portrait he painted&mdash;he entered into a close friendship,
and it was curious afterwards to see the two together at exhibitions&mdash;the
little figure of Menzel with his gigantic bald forehead and the little figure of
Meissonier with his gigantic beard, a Cyclops and a Gnome, two kings in the
realm of Liliput, of whom one was unable to speak a word of German and
the other unable to speak a word of French, although they had need merely
of a look, a shrug, or a movement of the hand to understand each other
entirely. He also came into the society of Courbet, who had just made the
famous separate exhibition of his works, at the Café Lamartine, in the company
of Heilbuth, Meyerheim, Knaus, and others. Here in Paris he produced
his first pictures of popular contemporary
life, and if as an historical painter
he had already been a leader in the
struggle against theatrical art, he
became a pioneer in these works also.
Everywhere he let in air and made
free movement possible for those who
pressed forward in his steps. In the
course of years he painted and drew
everything which excited in him artistic
impulse upon any ground whatever, and
not one of these endeavours was work
thrown away. A universal genius
amongst the painters of real life, he
combined all the qualities of which
other men of excellent talent merely
possessed fragments separately apportioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>
amongst them: the sharpest eye for every detail of form, the most
penetrative discrimination for the life of the spirit, and at times a glistening
play of colour possessed by none of his German predecessors.</p>

<p>Catholic churches seem always to have had a great attraction for him, as
well as the people moving in them, and in this an echo of his <i>rococo</i> enthusiasm
is still perceptible. The quaint, <i>rococo</i> churches in the ornate style favoured
by the Jesuits, which are still preserved intact in Munich and the Tyrol, were
those for which he had a peculiar preference. He lost himself voluptuously
in the thousand details of sculpture, framework, organs, balustrades, and
carved pulpits, dimly outlined in the subdued light from stained-glass windows.
In the gloom it was all transformed into a forest of ornaments, expanding
their traceries like trees in a wood. Sick and infirm people, women in prayer
burying their faces in their hands, and lame men with crutches, kneel or move
amid the luxuriant efflorescence of stone and wood and gold, of angels&rsquo; heads
and shrines, garlands of flowers, consoles, and fonts of holy water. Twisted
marble pillars, church banners, lamps and lustres mount in a confusion of
capricious outlines at once tasteful and piquant to the vaulted dome, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
the painted skies, blackened by the ascending mist of incense, seem waywardly
fantastic.</p>

<p>After the churches the salons appealed to him. There came his pictures
of modern society: ladies and cavaliers of the Court upon ballroom balconies,
the conversation of Privy Councillors in the salon, the marvellous ball supper,
where a mass of beautiful shoulders, splendid uniforms, and rustling silken
trains move amid mirrors, lustres, colonnades, and gilded frames. &ldquo;The
Ball Supper&rdquo; of 1870 is a vivid picture, bathed in glistening light. The
music has stopped. And from a door of the brilliantly lighted ballroom the
company is streaming into the neighbouring apartment, where the supper-table
has been laid, and groups of ladies and men in animated conversation
are beginning to occupy the chairs and sofas. In 1879 there followed the
famous &ldquo;Levee&rdquo;: the Emperor Wilhelm in the red Court uniform of the
<i>Gardes du Corps</i> is talking with a lady, surrounded by a sea of heads, uniforms,
and naked bowing shoulders. Though it was always necessary in earlier representations
of the kind to have a <i>genre</i> episode to compensate the insufficient
artistic interest of the work, in Menzel&rsquo;s pictures the pictorial situation is
grasped as a whole. They have the value of a book; they neither falsify nor
beautify anything, and they will hand down to the future an encyclopædia
of types of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>From the salon he went to the street, from exclusive aristocratic circles
into the midst of the eddying crowd. For many years in succession Menzel
was a constant visitor at the small watering-places in the Austrian and Bavarian
Alps. The multitude of people at the concerts, in the garden of the restaurant,
on the promenade, at the open-air services, were precisely the things to occupy
his brush. The light rippled through the leaves of the trees; women, children,
and well-bred men of the world listened to the music or the words of the
preacher. One person leaves a seat and another takes it; everything lives
and moves. Huge and lofty trees stretch out their arms, protecting the
company from the sun. Unusually striking was &ldquo;The Procession in Gastein&rdquo;:
in the centre was the priest bearing the Host, then the choristers in their
red robes, in front the visitors and tourists who had hastened to see the spectacle,
and in the background the mountain heights. The bustle of people
gives Menzel the opportunity for a triumph. In Kissingen he painted the
promenade at the waters; in Paris the Sunday gaiety in the garden of the
Tuileries, the street life upon the boulevard, the famous scene in the <i>Jardin
des Plantes</i>, with the great elephants and the vivid group of Zouaves and ladies;
in Verona the Piazza d&rsquo;Erbe, with the swarm of people crowding in between
the open booths and shouting at the top of their voices. Many after him
have represented such scenes, although few have had the secret of giving their
figures such seething life, or painting them, like Menzel, as parts of one great,
surging, and many-headed multitude.</p>

<p>People travelling have always been for him a source of much amusement:
men sitting in the corner of a railway carriage with their legs crossed and
their hats over their eyes, yawning or asleep; women looking out of the windows
or counting their ready money. Alternating with such themes are those
monotonous yet simple and therefore genial landscapes from the suburbs of
the great city, poor, neglected regions with machines and men at their labour.
Children bathing in a dirty stream bordered by little, stunted willows; small
craft gliding over a river, sailors leaping from one vessel to another, men
landing sacks or barrels, and great, heavy cart-horses dragging huge waggons
loaded with beer-barrels along the dusty country road. Or the scaffolding
of a house is being raised. Six masons are at work upon it, and they are
working in earnest. A green bush waves (German fashion) above the scaffolding,
and further off long rows of houses stretch away, and the aqueducts and
gas-works which supply the huge crater of Berlin, and day-labourers are seen
wheeling up barrow-loads of stones. For the first time a German painter
sings the canticle of labour.</p>

<p>From the streets he enters the work-places, and interprets the wild poetry
of roaring machines in smoky manufactories. The masterpiece of this group
is that bold and powerful picture, his &ldquo;Iron Mill&rdquo; of 1876. The workshop
of the great rail-forge of Königshütte in Upper Silesia is full of heat and steam.
The muscular, brawny figures of men with glowing faces stand at the furnace
holding the tongs in their swollen hands. Their vigorous gestures recall
Daumier. Upon the upper part of their bodies, which is naked, the light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>
casts white, blue, and dark red reflections, and over the lower part it flickers
in reddish, greenish, and violet tinges, on the creases in their clothing. The
smoke rising in spirals is of a whitish-red, and the beams supporting the roof
are lit up with a sombre glow. Heat, sweat, movement, and the glare of fire
are everywhere. Dust and dirt, strong, raw-boned iron-workers washing
themselves, or exhausted with hard toil, snatching a hasty meal, a confusion
of belting and machinery, no pretty anecdote but sober earnest, no
story but pure painting&mdash;these were the great and decisive achievements of
this picture. Courbet&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stone-breakers&rdquo; of 1851, Madox Brown&rsquo;s &ldquo;Work&rdquo;
of 1852, and Menzel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Iron Mill&rdquo; are the standard works in the art of the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Within German art Menzel has won an <i>enclave</i> for himself, a rock
amid the sea. In France during the sixties he represented German art
in general. France offered him celebrity, and after this recognition
he had the fortune to be honoured in his native-land before he was
overtaken by old age. His
realism was permitted to him
at a time when realistic aims
were elsewhere reckoned altogether
as æsthetic errors.
This explains the remarkable
fact that Menzel&rsquo;s toil of fifty
years had scarcely any influence
on the development of
German painting; it would
scarcely be different from
what it is now if he had
never existed. When he
might have been an exemplar
there was no one who dared
to follow him. And later,
when German art as a whole
had entered upon naturalistic
lines, the differences between
him and the younger generation
were more numerous than
their points of sympathy, so
that it was impossible for him
to have a formative influence.
He stood out in the
new period merely as a
power commanding respect,
like a hero of ancient times.
Even the isolated realistic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>
onsets made in Berlin in the seventies are in no way to be connected
with him.</p>

<p>If realism consisted in the dry and sober illustration of selected fragments
of reality, if upright feeling, loyalty, and honest patriotism were serviceable
qualities in art, a lengthier consideration should certainly be accorded to <i>Anton
von Werner</i>. In his <i>genre</i> pictures of campaign life everything is spick and span,
everything is in its right place and in soldierly order: it is all typically Prussian
art. His portraits are casino pictures, and as such it is impossible to imagine
how they could better serve their purpose. From the spurs to the cuirassier
helmet everything is correct and in accordance with military regulation; even
the likeness has something officially prescribed which would make any recruit
form front if suddenly brought face to face with such a person. In his pictures
of ceremonies his ability was just sufficient to chronicle the function in question
with the conscientiousness of a clerk in a law court. The intellectual capacity
for seeing more of a great man than his immaculately polished boots and the
immaculately burnished buttons of his uniform was denied him, as was the
artistic capacity of exalting a picture-sheet to the level of a picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span></p>

<p>Equipped with a healthy though trivial feeling for reality, <i>Carl Güssow</i>
ventured to approach nature in a sturdy and robust fashion in some of his
works, and exhibited in Berlin a few life-sized figures, &ldquo;Pussy,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Lover of
Flowers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lost Happiness,&rdquo; &ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Oyster Girl,&rdquo; and so forth.
Through these he opened for a brief period in Berlin the era of yellow kerchiefs
and black finger-nails, and on the strength of them was exalted by the critics
as a pioneer of realism or else anathematised, according to their æsthetic
creed. He had a robust method of painting muscles and flesh and clothes
of many colours, and of setting green beside red and red beside yellow, yet
even in these first works&mdash;his only works of artistic merit&mdash;he never got
beyond the banal and barbaric transcript of a reality which was entirely
without interest.</p>

<p><i>Max Michael</i> seems to be somewhat influenced by Bonvin. Like the latter,
he was attracted by the silent motions of nuns, juicy vegetables, dark-brown
wainscoting, and the subdued light of interiors. He was, like Ribot in France,
although with less artistic power, a good representative of that &ldquo;school of
cellar skylights&rdquo; which imitated in a sound manner the tone of the old Spanish
masters. One of his finest pictures, which hangs in the Kunsthalle in Hamburg,
represents a girls&rsquo; school in Italy. A nun is presiding over the sewing-lesson;
the background is brown; the light comes through the yellow glass of a
high and small window (like that of an attic), and throws a brown dusky tone
over the room, in which the gay costumes of the little Italian girls, with their
white kerchiefs, make exceedingly pretty and harmonious spots of colour. No
adventure is hinted at, no episode related, but the picturesque appearance of
the little girls, and their tones in the space, are all the more delicately rendered.
A refined scheme of colour recalling the old masters compensates for the want
of incident.</p>

<p>In Vienna <i>August von Pettenkofen</i> made a transition from the ossified,
antediluvian <i>genre</i> painting to painting which was artistically delicate. While
the successors of Gauermann and Danhauser indulged in heart-breaking scenes
or humorous episodes, Pettenkofen was the first to observe the world from
a purely pictorial point of view. Alfred Stevens had opened his eyes in Paris
in 1851. Troyon&rsquo;s pictures and Millet&rsquo;s confirmed him in his efforts. He was
brought up on a property belonging to his father in Galicia, and had been a
cavalry officer before he turned to painting: horses, peasants, and oxen are
the simple figures of his pictures. In the place of episodic, ill-painted stories
he set the meagre plains of lonely Pusta, sooty forges, gloomy cobblers&rsquo; work
shops, dirty courtyards with middens and rubbish-heaps, gipsy encampments,
and desolate garrets. There is no pandering to sentimentality or the curiosity
excited by <i>genre</i> painting. There are delicate chords of colour, and that is
enough. The artist was in the habit of spending the summer months in the
little town of Spolnok on the Theiss, to the east of Pesth. Here he wandered
about amongst the little whitewashed houses, the booths of general dealers,
and the fruit-sellers&rsquo; stalls. A lazily moving yoke of oxen with a lad asleep,
dark-eyed girls fetching water, poor children playing on the ground, old men
dreaming in the sun in a courtyard, are generally the only breathing beings
in his pictures. Here is a sandy village-square with low, white-washed houses;
there is a wain with oxen standing in the street, or a postilion trotting away on
his tired nag. Like Menzel, Pettenkofen paints busy humanity absorbed in
their toil, simple beings who do not dream of leaving off work for the sake
of those who frequent picture galleries. What differentiates him from the
Berlin painter is a more lyrical impulse, something tender, thoughtful, and
contemplative. Menzel gives dramatic point to everything he touches; he
sets masses in movement, depicts a busy, noisy crowd, pressing together and
elbowing one another, forcing their way at the doors of theatres or the windows
of cafés in a multifarious throng. Pettenkofen lingers with the petty artisan
and the solitary sempstress. In Menzel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Iron Mill&rdquo; the sparks are flying
and the machines whirring, but everything is peaceful and quiet in the cobblers&rsquo;
workshops and the sunny attics visited by Pettenkofen. Menzel delights in
momentary impressions and quivering life; Pettenkofen in rest and solitude.
In the former every one is thinking and talking and on the alert; in the latter
every one is yawning or asleep. If Menzel paints a waggon, the driver cracks
his whip and one hears the team rattling over the uneven pavement; in
Pettenkofen the waggon stands quietly in a narrow lane, the driver enjoys a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
midday rest, and an enervating, sultry heat broods overhead. Menzel has a
love for men and women with excitement written on their faces; Pettenkofen
avoids painting character, contenting himself with the reproduction of simple
actions at picturesque moments. The Berlin artist is epigrammatically
sharp; the Viennese is elegiac and melancholy. Menzel&rsquo;s pictures have the
changing glitter of rockets; those of Pettenkofen are harmonised in the tone of
a refined amateur. They have only one thing in common: neither has found
disciples; they are not culminating peaks in Berlin or Vienna art so much as
boulders wedged into another system.</p>

<p>Whilst the realistic movement in both towns was confined to particular
masters, Munich had once again the mission of becoming a guiding influence.
Here all the tendencies of modern art have left the most distinct traces, all
movements were consummated with most consistency. The heroes of Piloty
followed the divinities of Cornelius, and these were in turn succeeded by the
Tyrolese peasants of Defregger, and amid all this difference of theme one
bond connected these works: for interesting subject was the matter of chief
importance in them, and the purely pictorial element was something subordinate.
The efforts of the seventies had for their object the victory of this
pictorial element. It was recognised that the talent for making humorous
points and telling stories, which came in question as the determining quality
in the pictures of monks and
peasants of the school of Defregger
and Grützner, was the
expression of no real faculty
for formative art&mdash;that it was
merely technical incompleteness
complacently supported by
the lack of artistic sensibility
in the public which had produced
this narrative painting.
It was felt that the task of
formative art did not consist
in narrative, but in representation,
and in representation
through the most sensuous and
convincing means which stood
at its disposal. A renewed
study of the old masters made
this recognition possible.</p>

<p>Up to this time the most
miserable desolation had also
reigned over the province of
the artistic crafts. But, borne
up by the rekindled sentiment
of nationality, and favoured by the high tide of the milliards paid by France,
since 1870, that eventful movement bearing the words &ldquo;Old German&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Fine Style&rdquo; on its programme had become an accomplished fact. The
German Renaissance, which research had been hitherto neglected, was discovered
afresh. Lübke explored it thoroughly and systematically; Woltmann
wrote on Hans Holbein, Thausing on Dürer; Eitelberger founded the
Austrian Industrial Museum; Georg Hirth brought out his <i>Deutsches Zimmer</i>,
and began the publication of the <i>Formenschatz</i>. The national form of art of
the German Renaissance was taken up everywhere with a proud consciousness
of patriotism: here, it was thought, was a panacea. Those who followed
the artistic crafts declared open war against everything pedestrian and
tedious. <i>Lorenz Gedon</i> in particular&mdash;in union with Franz and Rudolf Seitz&mdash;was
the soul of the movement. With his black, curly hair, his little, fiery,
dark eyes, his short beard, his negligent dress, and his two great hands expert
in the exercise of every description of art, he had himself something of the
character of an old German stone-cutter. His manner of expressing himself
corresponded to this appearance. In every thing it was original, saturated
with his own personal conception of the world. As the son of a dealer in old
pictures and curiosities, he was familiar with the old masters from his childhood,
and followed them in the method of his study. He was far from confining
himself to one branch. The façades of houses, the architecture of
interiors, tavern rooms and festal decorations, furniture and state carriages,
statues and embellishments in stone, bronze, wood, and iron, portrait busts in
wax, clay, and marble, models for ornaments, for iron lattices, for the adornment
of ships and the fittings of cabins, all objects that were wayward, fantastic,
quaint, and curious lay in his province; and for the execution of each
in turn this remarkable man felt that he had in him an equal capacity. And,
at the same time, the temperament of a collector was united in him with that
of an artist in an entirely special way. In the bushy wilderness of a garden
before his house in the Nymphenburger Strasse countless stone fragments of
mediæval sculpture were strewn about, up to the very hedge dividing it from
the street. Rusty old trellises of wrought iron slanted in front of the windows,
and in the house itself the most precious objects, which artists ten years before
had passed without heed, stood in masses together. As Gedon was taken
from his work when he was forty his artistic endeavour never got beyond
efforts of improvisation, but the impulse which he gave was very powerful.
Through his initiative the whole province of the artistic crafts was brought
under observation from a pictorial point of view. The bald Philistine style
of decoration gave way and a blithe revel of colour was begun. The great
carnival feasts arranged by him on the model of the Renaissance period are an
important episode in the history of culture in Munich, and have contributed
in no unessential manner to the refinement of taste in the toilette of women.
The Munich Exhibition of the Arts and Crafts in 1876 (before the entrance
of which he had erected that great portal made of old fragments of architecture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>
wood-carving, and splendid stuffs, and bearing the inscription &ldquo;The
Works of our Fathers&rdquo;) indicated the zenith of that movement in the handicrafts
which was flooding all Germany in those days.</p>

<p>The course which was run by this movement in the following years is well
known, and it is well known how the imitation of the German Renaissance
soon became as wearisome as in the beginning it had been attractive. After
it had been a little overdone another step was taken, and from the Renaissance
people went to the <i>baroque</i> period, and soon afterwards the <i>rococo</i> period
followed. In these days sobriety has taken the place of this fever for ornamentation,
and the mania for style has resulted in a surfeit, a weariness and
a desire for simplicity and quietude. Nevertheless the beneficial influence of
the movement on the general elevation of taste is undeniable, and indirectly
it was of service to painting.</p>

<p>In rooms where the owner was the only article of the inventory repugnant
to the conception of style, only those pictures were admitted which had been
executed in the exact manner of the old masters. Works of art were regarded
as tasteful furniture, and were obliged to harmonise correctly with the other
appointments of the room; they had, moreover, to be themselves legitimate
&ldquo;imitations of the Works of our Fathers.&rdquo; And, in this way, the movement
in the handicrafts gave an impulse to a renewed study of the old masters,
carried out with far more refinement than had hitherto been the case.
Amongst the costume painters spread over all Germany, the experts in
costume, working in Munich during the seventies, form a really artistic race
of able painters who were peculiarly sensitive to colour. They were the
historians of art, the connoisseurs of colour in the ranks of the painters.
Piloty did not satisfy them; they
buried themselves in the study
of old masters with a delicately
sensitive appreciation of them;
they began to mix soft, luxuriant,
and melting colours upon their
palettes, and to feel the peculiar
joy of painting. Whilst they
imitated the exquisite &ldquo;little
masters&rdquo; of former ages, in dimly
lighted studios hung with Gobelins,
imitating at the same time the
beautifying rust of centuries, they
gradually abandoned all their own
tricks of art; and whilst they devoted
themselves to detail they
brought about the Renaissance
of oil-painting. Compared with
earlier works, their pictures are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>
like rare dainties. They no longer recognised the end of their calling, as
the <i>genre</i> painters had done, in a one-sided talent for characterisation,
but tried once more to lay chief weight upon the pictorial and artistic
appearance of their pictures. They were conscious of a presentiment that
there were higher spheres of art than the commonplace humour of <i>genre</i>
painting, and this recognition had a very wide bearing. Pictorial point took
the place of narrative humour. If artists had previously painted thoughts
they now began to paint things, and even if the things were bundles of straw,
mediæval hose, and the old robes of cardinals, they were no longer &ldquo;invented,&rdquo;
but something which had been seen as a whole. It was a transition towards
ultimately painting what had actually taken place before the artist&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>That sumptuous, healthy artist of such pictorial ability, <i>Diez</i>, the Victor
Scheffel of painting, stands at the head of the group. From his youth upwards
his chief place of resort had been the cabinet of engravings where he studied
Schongauer, Dürer, and Rembrandt, and all the boon-companions and vagabonds
etched or cut in copper or wood, and on the model of these he painted
his own marauders, robber-barons,
peasants in revolt, old
German weddings and fairs.
His picture &ldquo;To the Church
Consecration&rdquo; recalls Beham,
his &ldquo;Merry Riding&rdquo; Schongauer,
and his &ldquo;Ambuscade&rdquo;
Dürer, whilst Teniers served
as model for his fairs. Diez
knows the period from Dürer
and Holbein to Rubens, Rembrandt,
Wouwerman, and
Brouwer as thoroughly as an
historian of art, and sometimes&mdash;for
instance in his
&ldquo;Picnic in the Forest&rdquo;&mdash;he
has even drawn the eighteenth
century into the circle
of his studies. His pictures
had an unrivalled delicacy of
tone, and could certainly hang
beside their Dutch models in
the Pinakothek without losing
anything by such proximity.</p>

<p>Something of Brouwer or
Ostade revived once more
in <i>Harburger</i>, the talented
draughtsman of <i>Fliegende</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
<i>Blätter</i>, the undisputed monarch of the kingdom of slouching hats, old mugs,
and Delft pipes. Pictures like &ldquo;The Peasants&rsquo; Doctor,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Card-players,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Grandmother,&rdquo; &ldquo;By the Quiet Fireside,&rdquo; &ldquo;In the Armchair,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Easy-going Folk&rdquo; were masterpieces of delicate Dutch painting: the tone
of his pictures shows distinction and temperament; they have deep and fine
<i>chiaroscuro</i>, and are soft and fluent in execution. <i>Loefftz</i> with his picture
&ldquo;Love and Avarice&rdquo; appeared as Quentin Matsys <i>redivivus</i>, and then
attached himself in turn to Holbein and Van Dyck; and exercised, like Diez,
a great influence on the younger generation by his activity as a teacher.</p>

<p><i>Claus Meyer</i>, who became one of the best known amongst the young
Munich painters by his &ldquo;Sewing School in the Nunnery&rdquo; of 1883, is worthy of
remark inasmuch as he acquired a method of painting which was full of <i>nuances</i>,
through modelling himself upon Pieter de Hoogh and Van der Meer of Delft.
Through the windows hung with thin curtains the warm, quiet daylight falls
into the room, glancing on the clean boards of the floor, on the polished tops
of the tables, the white pages of the books, and the blond and brown hair of the
children, playing round it like a golden nimbus. Another sunbeam streams
through the door, which is not entirely closed, and quivers over the floor in
a bright and narrow strip of light. The intimate representation of peaceful
scenes of modest life, the entirely pictorial representation of peaceful and
congenial events, has taken the place of the adventures dear to <i>genre</i> painting.
Old gentlemen with a glass of beer and a clay pipe, servant-girls peeling
potatoes in the kitchen, pupils at the cloister sitting over their books in the
library, drinkers, smokers, and dicers&mdash;such were the quiet, passive, and silent
figures of his later pictures. The mild sunshine breaks in and plays over them.
Light clouds of tobacco smoke float in the air. Everything is homely and
pleasant, touched with a breath of pictorial charm, comfortable warmth, and
poetic fragrance. A hundred years hence his works will be sold as flawlessly
delicate and genuine old Dutch pictures. <i>Holmberg</i> became the historian of
cardinals. A window, consisting of rounded, clumpy panes, with little glass
pictures let in, forms the background of the room, and in the subdued oil-light
which beams over splendid vessels and ornaments, chests and Gobelins, the
white satin dresses of ladies in the mode of 1640, or the lilac and purple robes
of cardinals from the artist&rsquo;s rich wardrobe, are displayed, together with the
appropriate models.</p>

<p>In <i>Fritz August Kaulbach</i>, the most versatile of the group in his adoption
of various manners, the essence of this whole tendency is to be found. He did
not belong to the specialists who restricted themselves, in a one-sided fashion,
to the imitation of the Flemish or the Dutch masters, but appeared like old
Diterici, Proteus-like, now in one and now in another mask; and, whether he
assumed the features of Holbein, Carlo Dolci, Van Dyck, or Watteau, he had
the secret of being invariably graceful and <i>chic</i>.</p>

<p>When the German Renaissance was at its zenith he painted in the Renaissance
style: harmless <i>genre</i> pictures <i>à la</i> Beyschlag&mdash;the joys of love and of the
family circle&mdash;but not being so banal as the latter he painted them with more
delicate colouring and finer poetic charm. Certain single figures were found
specially acceptable&mdash;for instance, the daughters of Nuremberg patricians, and
noble ladies in the old German caps, dark velvet gowns, and long plaits like
Gretchen&rsquo;s, with their eyes sometimes uplifted and sometimes lowered, and
their hands at one moment folded and at another carrying a shining covered
goblet. Occasionally these single figures were portraits, but none the less
were they transformed into &ldquo;ladies in old German costume&rdquo;; and Kaulbach
understood how to paint, to the utmost satisfaction of his patrons, the black
caps, no less well than the little veil and the net of pearls, and the greenish-yellow
silk of the puffed sleeves, no less well than the plush border of the
dark gown and the antique red Gretchen pocket. Many of them held a lute
and stood amid a spring landscape, before a streamlet, or a silver-birch, such
as Stevens delighted in painting ten years previously. At that time Fritz
August Kaulbach, with greater softness in his treatment, occupied in Germany
the place which Florent Willems had occupied in Belgium. Since then he has
brought nearer to the public the most various old and modern masters, and he
has done so with fine artistic feeling: in his &ldquo;May Day&rdquo; he has revived the
pastoral scenes of Watteau with
a felicitous cleverness; in his
&ldquo;St. Cecilia&rdquo; he created a total
effect of great grace by going
arm in arm with Carlo Dolci
and Gabriel Max; his &ldquo;Pietà&rdquo;
he composed with &ldquo;the best
figures of Michael Angelo, Fra
Bartolommeo, and Titian,&rdquo; just
as Gerard de Lairesse had once
recommended to painters. Intermediately
he painted frail
flower-like girls <i>à la</i> Gabriel
Max, charming little angels <i>à la</i>
Thoma, children in Pierrot costume
<i>à la</i> Vollon, and little
landscapes <i>à la</i> Gainsborough.
He did not find in himself the
plan for a new edifice in erecting
his palace of art, but built
according to any plans that
came in his way; he simply
chose from all existing forms
the most graceful, the most
elegant, the most precious,
culled from their beauties only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
the flowers, and bound them into a tasteful bouquet. In his modern portraits
of women, which in recent years have been his chief successes, he
placed himself between Van Dyck and the English. Of course, a really <i>chic</i>
painter of women, like Sargent, is not to be thought of in this connection;
but for Germany these portraits were in exceedingly fine taste, had an interesting
Kaulbachian trace of indifferent health, and breathed an <i>odeur de femme</i>
which found very wide approval.
In his &ldquo;Lieschen,
the Waitress of the Shooting
Festival&rdquo; he risked a fresh
attempt at treating popular
life, and made of it such a
graceful picture that it might
almost have been painted by
Piglhein; while in a series of
spirited caricatures he even
succeeded in being&mdash;Kaulbach.
The history of art is wide, and
since Fritz August Kaulbach
knows it extremely well, he
will certainly find much to
paint that is pleasing and
attractive, &ldquo;<i>s&rsquo;il continue à
laisser errer son imagination à
travers les formes diverses créées
par l&rsquo;art de tous les temps</i>,&rdquo; as
the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i> said
of him on the occasion of the
Vienna World Exhibition of
1878.</p>

<p>After all, these pictures will
have little that is novel for an
historian of the next century.
&ldquo;<i>Être maître</i>,&rdquo; says W. Bürger,
&ldquo;<i>c&rsquo;est ne ressembler à
personne.</i>&rdquo; But these were
the works of painters who
merely announced the dogma
of the infallibility of universal
eclecticism, as the Caracci
had done in their familiar
sonnets: they were spirited
imitators, whose connection
with the nineteenth century
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
will be known in after years
only by the dates of their
pictures. As old masters
called back to life, they
have enriched the history
of art, as such, by nothing
novel. Yet, in replacing
superficial imitations by
imitations which were excellent
and congenial, they
have nevertheless advanced
the history of art in the
nineteenth century in another
way.</p>

<p>By the labour of his life
each one of them helped to
make a place in Germany for
the art of oil-painting, which
had been forgotten under
the influence of Winckelmann
and Carstens, and in
this sense their works were
very important stations, as
one might say, on the great
thoroughfare of art. Through systematic imitation of the finest old
masters, the Munich school had in a comparatively short time regained
the appreciation of colour and treatment which had so long been lost.
At a hazy distance lay those times when the distinctive peculiarity of
German painting lay in its wealth of ideas, its want of any sense for colour,
and its clumsy technique, whilst the æsthetic spokesmen praised these
qualities as though they were national virtues. These views had been
altogether renounced, and a decade of strenuous work had been devoted to the
extirpation of all such defects. Such an achievement was sufficiently great,
and sufficiently important and gratifying. This last resuscitation of the old
masters was capable of being turned into a bridge leading to new regions.</p>

<p>A feeling arose that the limit had been reached, and it arose in those very
men who had advanced furthest in pictorial accomplishment, adapting and
making their own all the ability of the old masters. Painters believed that
they had learnt enough of technique to be able to treat subjects from modern
life in the spirit of these old masters, not handling them any longer as laboriously
composed <i>genre</i> pictures, but as real works of art. And a group of realists
came forward as they had done in France, and began to seek truth with
scientific rigour and an avoidance of any kind of anecdotic by-play.</p>

<p>The greatest pupil of the old masters, <i>Franz Lenbach</i>, stands in a close and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
most important relationship
with these endeavours of
modern art, through some of
his youthful works.</p>

<p>The public has accustomed
itself to think of him only as
a portrait painter, and he is
justly honoured as the greatest
German portraitist of the
century. But posterity may
one day regard it as a special
favour of the gods that Lenbach
should have been born
at the right time, and that
his progress to maturity fell
in the greatest epoch of the
century. His gallery of portraits
has been called an epic
in paint upon the heroes of
our age. The greatest historical
figures of the century
have sat to him, the greatest
conquerors and masters in
the kingdom of science and
art. Nevertheless this gallery
would be worthless to posterity
if Lenbach had not had at his disposal one quality possessed by none
of his immediate predecessors, a sacred respect for nature. At a time when
rosy tints, suave smiles, and idealised drawing were the requirements necessary
in every likeness, at a time when Winterhalter painted great men, not as they
were, but as, in his opinion, they ought to have been&mdash;without reflecting that
God Almighty knows best what heads are appropriate for great men&mdash;Lenbach
appeared with his brusque veracity of portraiture. That alone was an achievement
in which only a man of original temperament could have succeeded. If
a portrait painter is to prevail with society a peculiar combination of faculties
is necessary, apart from his individual capacity for art. Lenbach had not
only an eye and a hand, but likewise elbows and a tongue which placed
him <i>hors concours</i>. He could be as rude as he was amiable, and as
deferential as he was proud; half boor and half courtier, at once a
great artist and an accomplished <i>faiseur</i>, he succeeded in doing a thing
which has brought thousands to ruin&mdash;he succeeded in forcing upon
society his own taste, and setting genuine human beings of strong character
in the place of the smiling automatons of fashionable painters.
In comparison with the works of earlier portrait painters it might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span>
said that a touch of pantheism and nature-worship goes through Lenbach&rsquo;s
pictures.</p>

<p>And what makes this so invaluable is that his greatness depends really less
upon artistic qualities than upon his being a highly gifted man who understands
the spirit of others. It is not merely artistic technique that is essential
in a portrait, but before everything a psychical grasp of the subject. No artist,
says Lessing, is able to interpret a power more highly spiritual than that which
he possesses himself. And this is precisely the weak side in so many portrait
painters, since a man&rsquo;s art is by no means always in any direct relationship with
the development of his spiritual powers. In this respect a portrait of Bismarck
by Lenbach stands to one by Anton von Werner, as an interpretation of
Goethe by Hehn stands to one by Düntzer. To speak of the congenial conception
in Lenbach&rsquo;s pictures of Bismarck is a safe phrase. There will always remain
something wanting, but since Lenbach&rsquo;s works are in existence one knows,
at any rate, that this something can be reduced to a far lower measure than it
has been by the other Bismarck portraits. &ldquo;<i>Bien comprendre son homme</i>,&rdquo;
says Bürger-Thoré, &ldquo;<i>est la première qualité du portraitiste</i>,&rdquo; and this faculty
of the gifted psychologist has made Lenbach the historian elect of a great
period, the active recorder of a mighty era. It even makes him seem greater
than most foreign portrait painters. How solid, but at the same time how
matter-of-fact, does Bonnat seem
by Lenbach&rsquo;s side! One should
not look at a dozen Bonnats together;
a single one arrests attention
by the plastic treatment
of the person, but if you see
several at the same time all the
figures have this same plastic
character, all of them have the
same pose, and they all seem to
have employed the same tailor.
Lenbach has no need of all that
characterisation by means of
accessories in which Bonnat delights.
He only paints the eyes
with thoroughness, and possibly
the head; but these he renders
with a psychological absorption
which is only to be found
amongst modern artists, perhaps
in Watts. In a head by Lenbach
there glows a pair of eyes which
burn themselves into you. The
countenance, which is the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
zone around them, is more or less&mdash;generally less&mdash;amplified; the second zone,
the dress and hands, is either still less amplified, or scarcely amplified at all.
The portrait is then harmonised in a neutral tone which renders the lack of
finish less obvious. In this sketchy treatment and in his striking subjectivity
Lenbach is the very opposite of the old masters. Holbein, and even Rubens&mdash;who
otherwise sets upon everything the stamp of his own personality&mdash;characterised
their figures by a reverent imitation of every trait given in nature.
They produced, as it were, real documents, and left it to the spectator to
interpret them in his own way.</p>

<p>Lenbach, less objective, and surrendering himself less absolutely to his
subject, emphasises one point, disregards another, and in this way conjures
up the spirit by his faces, just as he sees it. It may be open to dispute which
kind of portraiture is the more desirable; but Lenbach, at any rate, has now
forced the world to behold its great men through his eyes. He has given
them the form in which they will survive. No one has the same secret of
seizing a fleeting moment; no one turned more decisively away from every
attempt at idealising glorification or at watering down an individual to a type.
He takes counsel of photography, but only as Molière took counsel of his
housekeeper: he uses it merely as a medium for arriving at the startling
directness, the instantaneous impression of life, in his pictures. Works like
the portraits of King Ludwig I, Gladstone, Minghetti, Bishop Strossmayer,
Prince Lichtenstein, Richard Wagner, Franz Liszt, Paul Heyse, Wilhelm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
Busch, Schwind, Semper, Liphart, Morelli, and many others have no parallel
as analyses of the character of complex personalities. Some of his Bismarck
portraits, as well as his last pictures of the old Emperor Wilhelm, will always
stand amongst the greatest achievements of the century in portraiture. In
the one portrait is indestructible power, as it were the shrine built for itself by
the mightiest spirit of the century; in the other the majesty of the old man,
already half alienated from the earth, and glorified by a trace of still melancholy,
as by the last radiance of the evening sun. In these works Lenbach
appears as a wizard calling up spirits, an <i>évocateur d&rsquo;âmes</i>, as a French critic
has named him.</p>

<p>But what the history of art has forgotten in estimating the fame of the
portrait painter Lenbach is, that in the beginning of his career this very man
paved the way for the &ldquo;Realistic&rdquo; movement in German painting which
later he confronted so haughtily and with so much reserve. The first of
these works of his, which have for Germany much the same significance as
the early works of Courbet have for France, is the well-known &ldquo;Shepherd
Boy&rdquo; in the Schack Gallery. Stretched on his back, he lies in the high grass
where flowers grow thickly, and looks up while butterflies and dragon-flies
flutter through the dusty air of a Roman summer day. Such a frank, an
audacious, naked realism, breaking away from everything traditional in its
representation of fact, was
something entirely novel and
surprising in Germany in the
year 1856. Up to this time
no one had seen a fragment
of nature depicted with such
unqualified veracity. The
tanned shepherd lad, with his
naked sunburnt feet, covered
by a dark crust of mire from
the damp earth, seemed to be
lying there in the flesh, plastically
thrown into relief by the
glowing midday sun. The
next of these pictures, &ldquo;Peasants
taking Refuge from the
Weather,&rdquo; which appeared in
the exhibition of 1858, called
down a storm of indignation on
account of its &ldquo;trivial realism.&rdquo;
Every figure was painted
after nature with blunt and
rigorous sincerity, and no anecdotic
incident was devised in it.</p>

<p>After the sixties the influence of Courbet began to be directly felt. In the
days when he worked in Couture&rsquo;s studio <i>Victor Müller</i> had taken up some of
the ideas of the master of Ornans, and when he settled in 1863 in Munich,
Müller communicated to the painters there the first knowledge of the works
of the great Frenchman. He did not follow Courbet, however, in his subjects.
&ldquo;The Man in the Heart of the Night lulled to Sleep by the Music of a Violin,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Venus and Adonis,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hero and Leander,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hamlet in the Churchyard,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Venus and Tannhäuser,&rdquo; &ldquo;Faust on the Promenade,&rdquo; &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ophelia by the Stream&rdquo;&mdash;such are the titles of his principal works. But
how far they are removed from the anæmic, empty painting of beauty which
reigned in the school of Couture! Though a Romanticist of the purest water
in his subjects, Müller appears, in the manner in which he handles them, as a
Realist on whom there is no speck of the academical dust of the schools. The
dominant features of Victor Müller&rsquo;s pictures are the thirst for life and colour,
full-blooded strength, haughty contempt for every species of hollow exaggeration
and all outward pose, genuine human countenances and living human
forms inspired with tameless passion, an audacious rejection of all the traditional
rules of composition, and, even in colour, a veracity which in that age,
given up to an ostentatious painting of material, must have had an effect that
was absolutely novel. In 1863 the blooming flesh of his &ldquo;Wood Nymph&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span>
excited the Munich public to indignation, just as the nude female figures of
Courbet had roused indignation about the same time in Paris. Pictures
painted with singular sureness of hand were executed by him during the few
years that he yet had to live&mdash;portraits of dogs, landscapes of a flaming glow
of colour, single figures of red-haired Bacchantes and laughing flower-girls, old
men dying, and charming fairy pictures. The nearer he came to his death
the more his powers of work seemed to increase. The most remarkable ideas
came into his head. He drew, and painted without intermission designs
which had occupied him for years. &ldquo;I feel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;like an architect who
has been commissioned to carry out a great building, and I cannot do it:
I must die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the impulse which he had given in more than one direction had further
issues. As Hans Thoma in later years continued the work of the great Frankfort
master in the province of fairy-tale, <i>Wilhelm Leibl</i> realised Müller&rsquo;s
realistic programme.</p>

<p>Wilhelm Leibl, son of the conductor of music in the cathedral, was born at
Cologne on 23rd October 1844. At Munich he entered the studio of <i>Arthur
van Ramberg</i>, that unjustly forgotten master who, both by his own work and
by his activity as a teacher, exercised upon the younger Munich school a far
healthier influence than Piloty.
Ramberg was a modern man,
was always eager to come into
immediate contact with life and
break the fetters of tradition
which hung everywhere upon
that generation. He was an
aristocrat and a dandy, and,
having occupied himself in the
beginning with romantic fairy
subjects, he painted, soon after
his migration to Munich, a series
of pictures from modern life&mdash;&ldquo;Dachau
Girls on Sunday,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Return from the Masked
Ball,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Walk with the Tutor,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Meeting on the Lake,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Invitation to Boat,&rdquo; and
others, which rose above the mass
of contemporary productions by
their great distinction, fragrance,
and grace. At a time when
others held nothing but the
smock-frock fit for representation,
Ramberg painted the fashionable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
modern costume of women. And when others devoted themselves to clumsy
<i>genre</i> episodes, he created songs without words that were full of fine reserve,
nobility, and delicate feeling.</p>

<p><i>Rudolf Hirth</i>, who made a stir with his &ldquo;Hop Harvest&rdquo;; <i>Albert Keller</i>,
the tasteful painter of fashionable life; <i>Karl Haider</i>, the sincere and conscientious
miniature painter whose energy of manner had a suggestion of
the old masters, together with Wilhelm Leibl, all issued from Ramberg&rsquo;s
school, not from Piloty&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The young student from Cologne was thus saved, in the beginning, from
occupying himself with history, and he had no need to addict himself to
narrative <i>genre</i> painting, since his entire organisation preordained him to
painting pure and simple. Wilhelm Leibl was in those days a handsome
fellow, with powerful limbs and shining brown eyes. He was realism
incarnate&mdash;rather short, but strongly made, and with a frame almost
suggesting a beast of burden, broad in the chest, high-shouldered,
and bull-necked. His arms were thick and his feet large. His gait
was slow, heavy, and energetic, and he made with his arms liberal
gestures which took up a good deal of room. He had not the fiery spirit
of Courbet, being more prosaic, sober, and deliberate, but he resembled
him both in appearance and in the artistic faculty of eye and hand.
&ldquo;He had,&rdquo; as a French critic wrote of him, &ldquo;one of those organisations
which are predestined for painting, as Courbet had amongst us Frenchmen.
Such men extract the most remarkable things from painting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even his first picture, exhibited
in 1869, and representing
his two fellow-pupils
Rudolf Hirth and Haider
looking at an engraving, had
a soft, full golden harmony,
which left all the products of
conventional <i>genre</i> painting
far behind it, and came into
direct competition with the
refined works of the Dutch
painter Michael Swert. His
second picture, a portrait of
Frau Gedon, made an impression
even in Paris by its
Rembrandtesque beauty of
tone, and was awarded there
in 1870 the gold medal which
the judges had not ventured
to give him the year before
at Munich, because he was
still an Academy pupil. Yet 1869 was the decisive year in Leibl&rsquo;s life.
The Munich Exhibition gave at that time an opportunity for learning the
importance of French art upon a scale previously unknown. Over four
hundred and fifty pictures were accessible, and the works of the smooth,
conventional historical painters were the minority. Troyon was to be seen
there, and Millet and Corot. But Courbet, to whose works the committee
had devoted an entire room, was chiefly the hero, and one over whom
there was much conflict. Opinions were violently at odds about him in
the painters&rsquo; club. The official circle greeted the master of Ornans with the
same hoot of indignation which had been accorded him in France. But for
Leibl he became an adored and marvellous ideal. His eyes sparkled when
he sat opposite him at the <i>Deutsches Haus</i>, and in default of any other
means of making himself understood he assured Courbet of his veneration
by sturdily drinking to him: &ldquo;Prosit Courbet&mdash;Prosit Leibl.&rdquo; He stretched
his powerful limbs, and threw himself into vigorous attitudes to evince
in sanguinary quarrels, when necessary, his enthusiasm for the great Frenchman.
How false and paltry seemed the whole school of Piloty, with its
rose-coloured insipidity and its conventional bloom of the palette, when set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
against the downright veracity
and the masterly painting of
these works!</p>

<p>In the same year he went
to Paris, special occasion for
the journey being given by
a commission for a portrait
which he received from the
Duc Tascher de la Pagerie.
There he painted &ldquo;La Cocotte,&rdquo;
the portrait of a fat
Frenchwoman seated upon a
sofa and watching the clouds
of smoke from her clay pipe.
In its massive realism, and
in the exuberant power of
its broad, liquid painting, it
might have been signed
&ldquo;Courbet,&rdquo; and Leibl told
afterwards with pride how
Courbet slapped him on the
shoulder when he was at his
work, saying: &ldquo;<i>Il faut que
vous restez à Paris.</i>&rdquo; The
breaking out of the war
brought his residence in Paris
to an end more quickly than he had foreseen, but though he was there only
nine months that was long enough to give for ever a firm direction to the efforts
of the painter. Leibl became the apostle of Courbet in Germany, and in his
outward life the German Millet. Back once more in Bavaria, he migrated
in 1872 to Grasolfingen, then to Schondorf on the Ammersee, then to Berbling
near Aibling, and in 1884 to Aibling itself; he became a peasant, and, like
Millet, he painted pictures of peasants.</p>

<p>The poetic and biblical, the august and epical bias which characterises
the works of Millet, is not to be expected in Leibl. A spirit bent upon
what is great and heroic speaks out of Millet&rsquo;s pictures. A Rembrandtesque
feeling for space, the great line, the simplification, the
intellectual restraint from anecdotic triviality of form, are the things
which constitute his style. Leibl is at his best when he buries himself
with delight in the hundred little touches of nature. He triumphs
when he has to paint the faces of old peasant women, full of wrinkles,
and furrowed with care; the ruddy cheeks of girls, sparkling in all
their natural rustic freshness; figured dresses, the material and texture of
which are clearly recognisable; flowered silk kerchiefs worn round the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>
neck, coarse woollen bodices, and heavy hobnail shoes. He is to Millet
what Holbein is to Michael Angelo.</p>

<p>Nor can he be called an artist of intimate feeling in the sense in which the
Scandinavians are amongst the moderns. In Viggo Johansen the painter
disappears; what he paints has not the effect of a picture, but of a moment
of existence, a memory of something clear and familiar&mdash;something which
has been lived and seen, but not fashioned with deliberate intention. His
figures are like the sudden appearance of actual persons, spied upon, as if one
were looking through the window into a strange room under cover of night.
One feels that there is no occasion to pay the artist a compliment; but one
would like to sit in such a warm, cosy room, impregnated with tobacco smoke,
to inhale the fine cloud of steam issuing from the tea-kettle, to hear the water
bubbling and humming upon the glimmering fire. But the painter is always
seen in Leibl&rsquo;s pictures. A
communicative spirit, something
which touches the heart
and sets one dreaming, is
precisely what is not expressed
in them. The spectator
invariably thinks, in
the first place, of the astonishing
ability, the incredible
patience, which went to
the making of them. And
with all their photographic
fidelity he is, moreover, conscious
that the painter himself
was less concerned in
seizing the poetry of a scene,
the instantaneous charm of
an impression of nature, than
in forcing into the foreground
particular evidences of his
technical powers which he
has reserved for display. For
instance, newspapers in
which, if it is possible, a
fragment of the leading
article may be deciphered,
earthen vessels, bottles, and
brandy glasses, play in his
pictures a <i>rôle</i> similar to that
assumed by the little caskets
with brass covers that catch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>
the flashing lights, the overturned settles, the tapestry, and the globe in
works of the school of Piloty.</p>

<p>Wilhelm Leibl is a good workman, like Courbet, a man of fresh, vigorous,
and energetic nature and robust health, very material, and at times matter-of-fact
and prosaic. Painting is as natural to him as breathing and walking are
to the rest of us. He goes his way like an ox in the plough, steadily and
without tiring, without vibration of the nerves, and without the touch of
poetry. He goes where his instinct leads him and paints with a muscular
flexibility of hand whatever appeals to his eye or suits his brush. Opposed
to the neurotic and hurrying moderns, he has something of a mediæval monk
who sits quietly in his cell, without counting the hours, the days, and the years,
and embellishes the pages of his service-book with artistic miniatures, to depart
in peace when he has set &ldquo;Amen, Finis&rdquo; at the bottom of the last page. But
he has, too, all the capacity and all the boundless veneration for nature of
these old artists. He is the greatest <i>maître peintre</i> that Germany has had
in the course of the century, and in this sense his advent was of epoch-making
importance.</p>

<p>Even Defregger had observed peasant life altogether from a narrative and
anecdotic point of view. In Leibl this narrative <i>genre</i> has been overcome.
He had ability enough to give artistic attractions even to an &ldquo;empty subject.&rdquo;
To avoid exaggerated characterisation,
to avoid the expression
of anything divided into <i>rôles</i>, he
consistently painted people employed
in the least exciting occupations&mdash;peasants
reading a
newspaper, sitting in church, or
examining a gun. Pains are
taken to avoid the slightest movement
of the figures. Whilst all
his predecessors were romance
writers, Leibl is a painter. His
themes&mdash;simple scenes of daily
life&mdash;are a matter of indifference;
the beauty of his pictures lies in
their technique. They are works
of which it may be said that
every attempt to give an impression
of them in words is useless,
for they have not proceeded from
delight in anecdotic theme, but,
as in the good periods of art,
from the discipline of the sense
for colour and from an eminent
capacity for drawing: they are pictures in which mere interest in subject
is lost in the consideration of their artistic value, while the matter of
what is represented is entirely thrown into the background by the manner
in which it is carried out. The chief aim of the historical as of the
<i>genre</i> painters had been to draw a fluent cartoon based upon single
studies, to mix the colours nicely upon the palette, lay them upon the
canvas according to the rules, blend them and let them dry, so as
then to attain the proper harmony of colour by painting over again
and finally glazing. Leibl&rsquo;s mastery, which of itself resulted in an astonishing
truth to nature, lay in seizing an impression as quickly as
possible, taking hold of the reality rightly at the first glance, and transferring
the colours to his canvas with decision and sureness, in clear accord
with the hues of the original. Lessing&rsquo;s maxim, &ldquo;From the eyes straight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span>
to the arm and the brush,&rdquo; has been realised here for the first time in
Germany.</p>

<p>As yet no German had, in the same measure, what the painter calls
qualities, and even in France two apparently heterogeneous faculties have
seldom been united in one master in the same measure as they were
in Leibl: a broad and large technique, a bold <i>alla prima</i> painting, and,
on the other hand, a joy in work of detail with a fine brush, such as
was known by Quentin Matsys, the smith of Antwerp. &ldquo;The Village
Politicians&rdquo; of 1879 was the chief work that he painted in Schondorf. What
would Knaus, the king of illustration and the ruler over the province of
vignettes, have made out of this theme! By a literary evasion he would have
subordinated the interest of the picture to his ideas. One would have learnt
what it is that peasants read, and received instruction as to their political
allegiance to party and their offices and honours in the village: that would be
the magistrate, that the smith, and that the tailor. In Leibl there are true and
simple peasants, who, by way of relaxation from the toil of the week, listen
stupidly and indifferently to the reading of a Sunday paper, in which one of
them is endeavouring to discover the village news and the price of crops.
They are harsh-featured and common, but they have been spared theatrical
embellishment and impertinent satire; they are not artistically grouped,
though they sit there in all the rusticity of their physiognomies, and all the
angularity of their attitudes, without polish or Sunday state. Leibl renders
the reality without altering it, but he renders it fully and entirely. The
fidelity to nature held fast on the canvas surpassed everything that had hitherto
been seen, and it was gained, moreover, by the soundest and the simplest
means. Whereas Lenbach, in his effort to reproduce the colour-effects of the
old masters, destroyed the durability of his pictures even while he worked upon
them, Leibl seemed to have chosen as his motto the phrase which Dürer once
used in writing to Jacob Heller: &ldquo;I know that, if you preserve the picture
well, it will be fresh and clean at the end of five hundred years, for it has not
been painted as pictures usually are in these days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a further step in the direction of truth when he made a transition
from the Dutch towards the old German masters. After he had, in his earlier
productions, worked very delicately at the tone of his pictures, and, for a time,
had particularly sought to attain specific effects of <i>chiaroscuro</i>, attaching
himself to Rembrandt, he took up an independent position in his conception
of colour, painting everything not as one of the old masters might have seen
it, but as he had seen it himself. All the tricks of painting and sleights of
virtuosity were despised, special emphasis being scarcely laid upon pictorial
unity of effect. Everything was simple and true to nature, and had a sincerity
which is not to be surpassed.</p>

<p>The picture of the three peasant women, &ldquo;In Church,&rdquo; is the masterpiece
in this &ldquo;second manner&rdquo; of his, and when it appeared in the Munich International
Exhibition of 1883 it was an event. From that date Leibl was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span>
established&mdash;at any rate in the artistic circles of Munich&mdash;as the greatest
German <i>painter</i> of his time. That Leibl painted the picture without sketching
for himself an outline, that he began with the eye of the peasant girl and
painted bit by bit, like fragments of a mosaic, was a feat of technique in which
there were few to imitate him. The young generation in Munich studied the
pages of the service-book and the squares of the gingham dress, the girl&rsquo;s jug
and the carvings of the pew, with astonishment, as though they were the work
of magic. They were beside themselves with delight over such unheard-of
strength, power, and delicacy of modelling, the fusion of colour suggesting
Holbein, and the intimate study of nature. They perpetually discovered new
points that came upon them as a surprise, and many felt as Wilkie did when
he sat in Madrid before the drinkers of Velasquez, and at last rose wearily
with a sigh.</p>

<p>Leibl did for Germany what the pre-Raphaelites did for England. Men
and women were represented with astonishing pains just as they sat and
suffered themselves to be painted. He was determined to give the whole,
pure truth, and he gave it; that, and nothing more and nothing less. He
reproduced nature in her minutest traits and in her finest movements, bringing
the imitative side of art to the highest perfection conceivable. In virtue of
these qualities he was a born portrait painter; and although he never had
&ldquo;conception,&rdquo; as Lenbach had, his portraits belong, with those of Lenbach,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
to the best German performances of the century. Only Holbein when he
painted his &ldquo;Gysze&rdquo; had this remorseless manner of analysing the human
countenance in every wrinkle. Leibl once more taught the German painters
to go into detail, and led them constantly to hold nature as the only source
of art; and that has been the beginning of every renaissance.</p>

<p>His works were pictorially the most complete expression of the aims of the
Munich school in colour. As a representative of the efforts of the decade
from 1870 he is as typical as Cornelius for the art of the thirties, Piloty for that
of the fifties, and as Liebermann became later as a representative of the efforts
of the eighties.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Courbet</span> and Ribot for France, Holman Hunt and Madox Brown for
England, Stevens for Belgium, Menzel, Lenbach, and Leibl for Germany,
are the great names of modern Realism, the names of the men who subjected
modern life to art, and subjected art to the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>One point, however, the question of colour, still remained unsolved: as
the preceding generation took their form, so these painters took their colour,
not from nature, but from the treasury of old art.</p>

<p>Courbet announced it as his programme to express the manners, ideas,
and aspect of his age&mdash;in a word, to create living art. He described himself
as the sincere lover of <i>la vérité vraie</i>: &ldquo;<i>la véritable peinture doit appeler son
spectateur par la force et par la grande vérité de son imitation</i>.&rdquo;  But one may
question how far his figures, and the environment of them, are true in colour?
Where there is a delightful subtlety of fleeting <i>nuances</i> in nature, an oppressive
opaque heaviness is found in this modern Caravaggio of Franche-Comté.
He certainly painted modern stone-breakers, but it was in the tone of saints
of the Spanish school of the seventeenth century. His pictures of artisans
have the odour of the museum. The home of his men and women is not the
open field of Ornans, but that room in the Louvre where hang the pictures
of Caravaggio.</p>

<p><i>Alfred Stevens</i> made a great stride by painting modern <i>Parisiennes</i>. Whereas
the costume picture had up to his time sought the truth of the old masters
only in the matter of the skirts which the fashion of their age prescribed,
Stevens was the first to dress his women in the garb of 1860, just as Terborg
painted his in the costume of 1660 and not of 1460. But the very atmosphere
in which the <i>Parisienne</i> of the nineteenth century lived is no longer that in
which the women of de Hoogh moved. The whole of life is brighter. The
studios in which pictures are painted are brighter, and the rooms in which
they are destined to hang. Van der Meer of Delft, the greatest painter of
light amongst the Dutch, still worked behind little casements; and in dusky
patrician dwellings, &ldquo;where the very light of heaven breaks sad through
painted window,&rdquo; his pictures were ultimately hung. The old masters paid
special attention to these conditions of illumination. The golden harmony
of the Italian Renaissance came into being from the character of the old
cathedrals furnished with glass windows of divers colours; the half-light of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
the Dutch corresponded to the dusky studios in which painters laboured,
and the gloomy, brown-wainscoted rooms for which their pictures were destined.
The nineteenth century committed the mistake even here of regarding what
was done to meet a special case as something absolute. Rooms had long
become bright when studios were artificially darkened, and artists still sought,
by means of coloured windows and heavy curtains, to subdue the light, so as
to be able to paint in tones dictated by the old masters. Stevens shed over
a modern woman, a <i>Parisienne</i>, sitting in a drawing-room in the Avenue de
Jena, the light of Gerard Dow, without reflecting that this illumination,
filtered through little lattice-windows, was quite correct in Holland during
the seventeenth century, but no longer proper in the Paris of 1860, in a salon
where the windows had great cross-bars and clear white panes which were
not leaded. It is chiefly this that makes his pictures untrue, lending them
an old Flemish heaviness, something earthy, savouring of the clay, and not
in keeping with the fresh fragrance of the modern <i>Parisienne</i>. Her modernity
is seen through the yellowish glass which the old Flemish masters seemed to
hold between Stevens and his model.</p>

<p>Considered as a separate personality <i>Ribot</i>, too, is a great artist; his works
are masterpieces. Yet when young men spoke of him as the last representative
of the school of cellar-windows
there was an atom of truth in
what they said. Like Courbet,
he continued the art of galleries.
The master of a style and yet
the servant of a manner, he
marks the summit of a tendency
in which the great traditions of
Frans Hals and Ribera were once
more embodied. When he paints
subjects resembling the themes of
these old masters he is as great
as they are, as genuine and as
much a master of style; but as
soon as he turns to other subjects
the imitative mannerist is revealed.
Even things as tender
and unsubstantial as the flowers
of the field seem as if they were
made of wax. His disdain for
what is light, fluent, and fickle,
like air and water, is evident in
his sea-pieces. His steamers
plough their way through a greyish-black
sea beneath a thick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
black stormy sky, as though
through grey deserts. Nature
quivering in the air and bathed
in light is not so heavy and compact,
nor has it such plasticity of
appearance. His women reading
are the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of painting;
only it is astonishing that any
human being can read in such
a dark room.</p>

<p>Ribot&rsquo;s parallel in Germany is
<i>Lenbach</i>, who had less pictorial
and greater intellectual power.
As a painter of copies, particularly
copies of the artists of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
he formed and perfected a
school for the understanding of
the old masters, as none of his
contemporaries had done. The
copies which he made as a young
man for Count Schack in Italy
and Spain are probably the best
translations by the brush that
have ever been executed. He has
reproduced Titian and Rubens,
Velasquez and Giorgione, with equal magic; no other painter has entered
into all the subtleties of their technique with such intelligence and keenness;
and by the aid of these sleights of art, which he learnt as a copyist from
classic masterpieces, he communicated to his own works that impress
which qualifies them for the gallery and suggests the old masters with such
refinement. His pictures mark the summit of ability reached in Germany
in the pictorial style of the old artists.</p>

<p>But, at the same time, his weakness lies in this very eminence. The man
who had passed through the high-school of the old masters with the greatest
success was entered as a student for life, and never took the professorial chair
himself. Helferich has called him the impersonated spirit of the galleries,
the spirit which is centuries old.</p>

<p>This indicates the direction which must be taken by the further development
of painting. A really new and independent art must finally emancipate
itself from the Renaissance colouring, the tone of Church painting, and the
<i>chiaroscuro</i> of pictures painted behind the variegated panes of lattice-windows.
It must be evident that the methods of the old Spanish and old Dutch schools,
excellent in themselves, were fully in keeping with strange scenes of martyrdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
or quiet interiors with peasants and fat matrons, but that they could
not possibly be employed in pictures of artisans beneath the free sky, nor in
those of elegant interiors of our own days, nor of pale and delicate <i>Parisiennes</i>
attired in silks, beings of a new epoch.  A different period necessitates different
methods. It is not merely that the subjects of art change, but the way in
which they are handled must bear the marks of the period. Nature should
no longer be studied through the prism of old pictures, and the phrase <i>beau
par la vérité</i> must be exalted to a principle applying to colour also.</p>

<p>The pre-Raphaelites and Menzel were the first to become alive
to the problem. They were never taken captive by the tones of the
early masters, but placed themselves always in conscious opposition to
the artists of older ages. The battle against &ldquo;brown sauce&rdquo; even
formed an essential point in the programme of the Brotherhood. They
protested against conventional colouring as violently as against the
sweeping line taught by traditional rules of beauty.</p>

<p>But, as so often happens
in the nineteenth century,
though the English found the
jewel, they did not understand
how to cut it. The pre-Raphaelites
had a quickening
influence, in exciting a feeling
for hue and tint, and rendering
it keener by their own
insistence on the elementary
effects of colour. They sought
to free themselves from brown
sauce and to be just to local
tones, through straightforward,
independent observation.
They painted the trees
green, the earth grey, the sky
blue, the sunbeams yellow, in
sharply accentuated colours,
as little blended as possible.
But in most cases the result
was not particularly pleasant;
there was almost always a
hard, motley colouring which
produced a most unpleasant,
glaring effect. Their audacity
was somewhat barbaric.
There was a want of warmth
and softness, the atmosphere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span>
did not combine the whole by its mitigating and harmonising power. Even
Madox Brown&rsquo;s &ldquo;Work&rdquo; is an offensive chaos of crying colours. The bright
clothes, the blue blouses, the red uniforms have a gaudy and unquiet effect.
The problem was attacked, but the solution was harsh and crude.</p>

<p>Of <i>Menzel&rsquo;s</i> pictures the same is true, though not perhaps in the same
degree. In pictorial conception he also has not quite reached the summit.
His method of painting is sometimes sparkling and full of spirit, holding the
mean, more or less, between the quiet and plain painting of Meissonier and
the crisp, glittering style of Fortuny; he lets off a flickering, dazzling, rocket-like
firework, but at bottom he has been cut from the block from which
draughtsmen are made. Sometimes it is astonishing how his brush sweeps
over costumes, ornaments, and buildings, but he does not think in colour;
it is supplementary to the drawing, and not of earlier origin, nor even of
equal birth. Much as he tried to paint smoke and steam in his &ldquo;Iron Mill,&rdquo;
he had no understanding for atmospheric life; for this reason harsh and
glaring tones almost invariably make a disturbing effect in his works. His
&ldquo;Piazza d&rsquo;Erbe&rdquo; as well as his &ldquo;King Wilhelm setting out to join the Army&rdquo;
have a motley and restless effect in the picture, and only in photography or
black and white do they acquire something of the simplicity which is to be
desired in the originals. The best of his drawings may stand beside the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
sketches of Dürer without detriment; to place his pictures on the same level
is impossible, because quietude and pure harmony are wanting in them.</p>

<p>So extremes meet. Courbet, Ribot, and Lenbach are greater connoisseurs
of colour than Europe had seen previous to their appearance, but this they
are at the expense of truth; they have identified themselves with the old
masters, and not arrived at any personal conception of colour. Menzel and
the pre-Raphaelites despised the old masters, but their conception of colour
had something primitive, jarring, and undisciplined.</p>

<p>The note of truth was still missing in the mighty orchestra. By what
possible means could it be supplied? How bring to perfection that great
harmony which is ever the end and aim of all true artistic effort. It was not
until the art of the Far East was unfolded before the eyes of Western painters
that this disquieting problem reached its solution.</p>

<p>In the year in which Millet exhibited his &ldquo;Winnower&rdquo; and Courbet
painted his &ldquo;Stone-breakers&rdquo; a man died in the Far East whose name was
Hokusai. He was the last great representative of an art of painting more
than a thousand years old&mdash;one which had no Raphael, Correggio, or Titian,
though it was, nevertheless, art in the loftiest meaning of the word. Marco
Polo, the great traveller of the Middle Ages, had told of a remarkable land
&ldquo;towards the sunrise,&rdquo; the soil of which it was not permitted to him to tread.
And the artistic views of the eighteenth century were revolutionised when
the first Japanese porcelain and lacquer-work arrived at the Courts of Dresden
and Paris. The aged Louis XIV himself began to find pleasure in idols,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
pagodas, and &ldquo;stuffs printed with flowers.&rdquo; In a short time these works
formed an important part of superior collections, and led to the movement
against the inflexible despotism of the pompous Lebrun style. For the
Japanese gave Europe the unfettered principles of a freer intuition of beauty;
they excited a preference for things which were unsymmetrical, capricious,
full of movement, for everything by which the charming Louis <span class="sc">XV</span> style is
to be distinguished from the tiresome academic art of Louis <span class="sc">XIV</span>. In the
sixties of the nineteenth century Japan exerted, for the second time, a revolutionary
influence on the development of European painting. If Japanese
productions were in earlier days regarded as curiosities, for which place was
to be found in cabinets of rarities, as trifles the artistic value of which was
less prized than the dexterity of their construction, it was reserved for the
present age to do justice to Japanese art as such.</p>

<p>As is well known, oil-painting exists neither in China nor Japan. Just
as the Japanese choose the slightest material for building, so everything in
their painting bears a trace of extreme lightness. Japanese pictures, <i>kakemonos</i>,
are painted in water colour or Chinese ink upon framed silk or paper;
but this paper has an advantage over the European article in its unsurpassed
toughness, its remarkable softness and pliability, its surface which has either
a dull, silky lustre, or may only be compared with the finest parchment.
And the pictures themselves are kept rolled up, and only hung, as occasion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span>
offers, in the Tokonama, the little closet near the reception-room, and according
to very refined rules. Only a few are hung at a time, and only such as
harmonise. When a visit is expected the taste of the guest determines the
selection. Fresh and variously coloured flowers and branches, placed near
them in vases, are obliged to harmonise in colour with the pictures.</p>

<p>As an instrument for painting use is only made of the pliant brush of hair,
which executes everything with a free and fluent effect. Pen, crayon, or
chalk, and all hard mediums which offer resistance, are consistently excluded.
The subject-matter of these pictures is surprisingly rich, and assumes for
their proper understanding some acquaintance with Japanese literature. An
opulent folk-lore, in which cannibals and heroes like Tom Thumb live and
move and have their being, just as in European fairy stories, stands at the
disposal of the artist. Historical representations from the life of fabulous
national heroes, ghosts, and apparitions half man and half bird, alternate
with simple landscapes and scenes from daily life. And in all pictures,
whether they are fanciful or plain renderings of fact, attention is riveted
by the same keenness of observation, the same refinement of taste, in
the highest sense of the word by pictorial charm. After the Japanese
have been long recognised as the first decorative artists in the world,
after the highest praise has been accorded to them in the industrial crafts
taken jointly&mdash;in lacquer-work and bronze work, weaving, embroidery,
and pottery&mdash;they are now likewise celebrated as the most spirited
draughtsmen in existence.</p>

<p>The Japanese artist lives with nature and in her as no artist of any other
country has ever done. Life in the open air creates a relation to nature
suggestive of the doctrines of Rousseau; it makes earth, sky, and water as
familiar to man as are the beings that move in them. Every house, even in the
centre of towns, has a garden laid out with
fine taste, and combining beautiful flowers,
trees, and cascades, everything incidental
to the soil. The form of trees, the shape
and colour of flowers, the ripple of leaves,
and the gleaming mail of insects are so
imprinted in the memory of the painter
that his fancy can summon them at
pleasure without the need of fresh study.
The most fleeting moment of the life of
nature is held as firmly in his mind as the
everlasting form of rocks and gigantic
trees shadowing the temple groves of
Nippon. Every one of these artists works
with the unfettered falcon glance of the
child of nature. His keen eye sees in the
flight of birds turns and movements first
revealed to us by instantaneous photography.
This quickness of eye and this
astonishing exercise of memory enable him
to obtain the most striking effects with
the slightest means. If a Japanese executes
figures, race, station, age, business, personality
are all seized with the keenest vision,
and pregnantly rendered in their essential
features. Robes and unclad forms, heads
and limbs, animated and still nature, are
all reproduced with the same reality. Yet
little as the doctrine ever gained ground
that to create works of art nature should
be mastered upon a system, trivial realism
was just as little at any time the vogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span></p>

<p>The love of nature is born in the
Japanese, but the photographic imitation,
the servile reproduction of reality, is
never his ultimate aim. Geoffroy has
noted with much subtlety the resemblance
which exists between Japanese poets and
painters in this respect. Their poets never describe, but only endeavour to
express a spiritual feeling, to hold a memory fast&mdash;the blitheness of smiling
pleasure, the mournfulness of vanished joy. They sing of the mist passing
over the mountain summits, the fishing boats, the reeds by the seashore, the
plash of waves, the flying streaks of cloud, the sunset streaming purple over
the weary world. The same economy of means, the same sureness in the
choice of characteristic features, and a similar rapidity in striking the keynote
are peculiar to the painters. They, too, express themselves by the scantiest
means, shrink from saying too much, and aim only at a rapid and right expression
of total effect, leaving to the imagination the task of supplementing and
amplifying what is given. The heaviness of matter is overcome, the absurd
pretence of reality not attempted. Like the French of the eighteenth century,
the Japanese possess the sportive grace, the <i>esprit</i> of the brush hovering over
objects, extracting merely their bloom and essence, and using them as the
basis for free and independent caprices of beauty. They have the remarkable
faculty of being synthetic and discarding every ponderous and disturbing
element, without losing the local accent in a landscape or a figure. They
fasten upon the most vivid impression of things, but in great, comprehensive
lines, subordinating every peculiarity to the
light which shines upon them and the shadow
in which they are muffled. Their handwriting
is at once broad and precise, graceful and
bizarre. What a nonchalant, fragile, piquant,
or coquettish effect have their feminine figures!
And but a few firm strokes sufficed to create
the impression. A dexterous sweep of the brush
was all that was necessary for the modelling,
all that was wanted to summon the idea of
the velvet softness of the flesh and the firmness
of the bosom. Or surging waves have
been painted, or foaming cataracts. But with
what consummate mastery, with what peculiar
knowledge, the swirl and eddying of the waters
have been represented. And how slight are
the means which have been employed!
Everything has the freshness of life, and the
sheer, intangible movement of objects has
been caught by a simple and decisive line. A
few dashes of Chinese ink are made, and the
forcible strokes unite without effort in forming
a mountain path or a hillside stream foaming
over rocks and trees. Or the prow of a vessel is
represented. Nothing is to be seen of the
water, and yet it is as if the waves were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span>
rocking the ship. The billow swells, rises, and sinks, suggesting the wide
sea, the rhythm in the universe. The lines in which the motives are executed
render only what is essential. But combined with this striving after
simplified form there is a sense of space which of itself, as it were, controls
everything, producing the poetic illusion of distance.</p>

<p>The Japanese are masters of the art of enlarging a narrow picture frame
to a great expanse, and indicating by a few strokes the distance between
foreground and horizon. There is often nothing, or next to nothing, in the wide
space, but proximity and distance are so correctly related that all the geological
structure is clear, whilst light air is pervasive, giving the eye a vision of boundless
perspective. The spur of a headland, the bank of a river, or a cleft between
two mountains enables the eye to measure far landscapes. In the presence of
their works one dreams, one has the presentiment of infinite distances. They
divest objects of their earthiness by bold simplifications, and transform reality
into dreamland. It is the spirit of things, their smile, and their intangible
perfume which live in these veiled masterpieces which are yet so precise.</p>

<p>The bold irregularity of Japanese works, which know nothing of the stiffness
of symmetrical composition, contributes much to this impression. Their
pictures are never &ldquo;composed&rdquo; in our sense of the word, but rather resemble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
the instantaneous pictures of photographers. A bird is seen to dart past,
only half visible, a cluster of trees is a chance slice from the forest, as it is seen
out of the window of a railway train whizzing past. Or it is merely the bough
of a tree with a bird upon it that stretches into the picture, which is otherwise
filled with a fragment of blue sky. Without appearing to concern themselves
about it, they compose little poems of grace and freshness, with a frog, a
butterfly, and a blossoming apple-branch sprouting out of a vase. They play
with beetles, grasshoppers, tortoises, crabs, and fish as did the artists of the

<p>And in everything, as regards colour too, the Japanese have a strain of
refinement peculiar to themselves. It is as though they were controlled by
the finest tact, as by a <i>force majeure</i>, even in their intuition of colour. That
great harmony of which Théodore Rousseau spoke, and to which it was the aim
of his life to attain, is reached by the Japanese artist almost instinctively.
The most vivid effects of red and green trees, yellow roads, and blue sky are
represented; the most refined effects of light are rendered&mdash;illuminated bridges,
dark firmaments, the white sickle of the moon, glittering stars, the bright and
rosy blossoms of spring, the dazzling snow as it falls upon trim gardens; and
there are discords nowhere. How heavy and motley our colouring is compared
with these delicious chords, set beside each other so boldly, and invariably
so harmonious. Is it that our eyes are by nature less delicate? or is
everything in the Japanese only the result of a more rational training?  We
have not the same intense force of perception, this instinctive and sensuous
gift of colour. Their colouring is a delight to the eyes, a magic potion. Offence
is nowhere given by a glaring or an entirely crude tone; everything is finely
calculated, delicately indicated, and has that melting softness so enchanting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
in Japanese enamel. The simplest chords of colour are often the most effective;
nothing can be more charming than the delicate duet of grey and gold. And
the cheapest wood-cut has often all these refinements in common with the most
costly <i>kakemono</i>. Even here, where they turn to lowly things, their art is
never vulgar, but maintains itself at such an aristocratic height that we
barbarians of the West, blessed with oleographs and Academies of Art, can
only look up with envy to this nation of connoisseurs.</p>

<p>The oldest of these Japanese artists working in wood-cut engraving was
Matahei, who lived in the beginning of the seventeenth century, and executed
scenes from the theatres and Japanese family and street life. Icho and
Moronobu followed at the close of the seventeenth century, the one being a
spirited caricaturist, the other a genuine <i>baroque</i> artist of noble and classic
reserve. Through the masters of the eighteenth century, as through Eisen,
Fragonard, and Boucher, this reproductive art took fresh development. The
soft girls of Soukénobu with their delicate round faces, the graceful beauties of
Harunobu arrayed in costly toilettes, the tall feminine forms of the marvellous
Outamaro in all their provocative charm, the vivid scenes from popular life
of the great colourist Shunsho, are works pervaded with a delicate perfume of
which Edmond de Goncourt alone could render any impression in words.</p>

<p>Outamaro, the poet of women, was, in a special sense, the Watteau of
aristocratic life in Japan. He knew the life of the Japanese woman as no
other has ever done&mdash;her domestic occupations, her walks and her charming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
graces, her vanities and her love affairs. He knew also the scenes of nature
which she contemplated, the streets through which she passed, and the banks
along which she sauntered with an undulating step. His women are slender
beings, isolated like idols, and standing motionless in poses hieratically august;
æsthetic souls, who swoon and grow pale under the sway of disquieting
visions; fading flowers, forms roaming wearily by the verge of a lonely sea
or a sluggish stream, or flitting timidly, like bats, through the soft brilliancy
of lights amid a festival by night. And in killing what is fleshly and physical
he renders the faces visionary and dreamy, renders the hands and the gestures
finer, and at the same time subdues and mitigates the colours and the
splendour of the clothes, taking pleasure in dying chords, in deep black and
tender white, in fine, pallid <i>nuances</i> of rose-colour and lilac. Every one of
his pupils became a fresh chronicler of aristocratic life. Toyohami painted
night festivals; Toyoshiru, animated crowds; Toyokumi, scenes of the
theatre; Kunisada, women upon their walks; Kunioshi, melodramatic representations
full of pomp, with marvellous fantastic landscapes.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century brought the widest popularisation of art, corresponding
more or less to the &ldquo;resort to popular national life,&rdquo; as the beginning
of modern <i>genre</i> painting and of the modern art of illustration was
called in Germany. The refined son of Nippon shrugs his shoulders over
these last creations of Japanese reproduction in colours; he prefers those
earlier charming masters of grace, and misses the aristocratic <i>cachet</i> in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span>
new men, with as much justification as the refined European collector has
when he does not care to place the plates of Granville or Doré in a portfolio
with those of Eisen or Fragonard. Nevertheless amongst the draughtsmen
who followed the popular tendency there was at any rate one great genius,
one of the most important artists of his country, who became more familiar
to Europe than any of his other compatriots: this was <i>Hokusai</i>.</p>

<p>All the qualities of Japanese art are united in him as in a focus. His
work is the encyclopædia of a whole nation, and in his technical qualities he
stands by the side of the greatest men in Europe. He is the most attentive
observer, a painter of manners as no other has ever been; he takes strict
measure of everything, analysing the slightest movements. He draws the
solid things of earth, the immovable rocks, the everlasting primæval mountains,
and yet follows the changing phenomena of light and shade upon its surface.
He has, in the highest degree, that peculiarly Japanese quality of giving
tangible expression to the movements of things and living creatures. His
men and women gesticulate, his animals run, his birds fly, his reptiles crawl,
his fish swim; the leaves on the trees, the water of the rivers, and the sea
and the clouds of the sky move gently. He is a magnificent landscape painter,
celebrating all the seasons, from blossoming spring to ice-bound winter. In
his designs he maps out orchards, fields, and woods, follows the winding
course of rivers, summons a fine mist from the sea, sends the waves surging
forward, and the billows racing up against the rocks and losing themselves
as murmuring rivulets in the sand. But he is also a philosopher and a poet
of wide flight, who makes the boldest journeys into the land of dreams. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
imagination rises above the work-a-day
world, rides upon the
chimera, bodies forth a new life,
creates monsters, and tells visions
of terrible poetry. The deep
feeling of the primitive masters
revives in him, and he appears
as a strange mystic, when he
paints his blithe ethereal goddesses,
or that old Buddhist who,
when banished, came every day
across the sea, as the legend tells,
to behold once more Fuji, the
sacred mountain.</p>

<p>Hokusai was born in 1760,
amid flowery gardens in a quiet
corner of Yeddo, fourteen years
after Goya and twelve years after
David. His father was purveyor
of metallic mirrors to the Court.
Hokusai took lessons from an
illustrator, but does not seem to
have been much known until his
fortieth or fiftieth year. In 1810
he first founded an industrial
school of art, which attracted
numbers of young people. To provide them with a compendium of
instruction in drawing he published in 1810 the first volume of his <i>Mangwa</i>.
From that time he was recognised as the head of a school. When his fame
began to spread he changed his residence almost every month to protect
himself from troublesome visitors. And just as often did he alter his name.
Even that under which he became famous in Europe is only a pseudonym,
like &ldquo;Gavarni&rdquo;: amongst various <i>noms de guerre</i> it was that which he bore
the longest and by which he was definitely recognised.</p>

<p>As a painter he was only active in his youth. The achievement of his
life is not his pictures, but a magnificent series of illustrated books, a life&rsquo;s
work richer than that of any of his compatriots. Like Titian and Corot, fate
had predestined him to reach a very great age without ever growing old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From my sixth year,&rdquo; he writes in the preface to one of his books, &ldquo;I
had a perfect mania for drawing every object that I saw. When I had reached
my fiftieth year I published a vast quantity of drawings; but I am unsatisfied
with all that I have produced before my seventieth year. At seventy-three
I had some understanding of the form and real nature of birds, fish, and
plants. At eighty I hope to have made further progress, and at ninety to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span>
have discovered the ultimate foundation of things. In my hundredth year
I shall rise to yet higher spheres unknown, and in my hundred and tenth,
every stroke, every point, and in short everything that comes from my hand
will be alive.&rdquo; Hokusai certainly did not reach so great an age as that. He
died at eighty-nine, on 13th April 1849, and is buried in the temple at Yeddo.
During the period between 1815 and 1845 he published about eighty great
works, altogether over five hundred volumes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rose from my seat at the window, where I had idled the whole day
long ... softly, softly.... Then I was up and away.... I saw the
countless green leaves tremble in the densely embowered tops of the trees;
I watched the flaky clouds in the blue sky, collecting fantastically into shapes
torn and multiform.... I sauntered here and there carelessly, without
aim or volition.... Now I crossed the Bridge of Apes and listened as the
echo repeated the cry of the wild cranes.... Now I was in the cherry-grove
of Owari.... Through the mists shifting along the coast of Miho I descried
the famous pines of Suminoye.... Now I stood trembling upon the Bridge
of Kameji and looked down in astonishment at the gigantic Fuki plants.... Then
the roar of the dizzy waterfall of Ono resounded in my ear. A shudder
ran through me.... It was
only a dream which I dreamed,
lying in bed near my window
with this book of pictures by
the master as a cushion beneath
my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In these words a learned
Japanese has indicated the
great range of subject, the
unspeakably rich material of
the works of the master.
By preference he leads us to
the work-places of artisans, to
woodcarvers, smiths, workers
in metal, dyers, weavers, and
embroiderers. Then come the
pleasures of the nobility, who
are displayed in their refinement,
reserve, and dignity;
the country-folk at their daily
avocations, or making merry
upon holidays; the fantastic
shapes of fabulous animals
and demons, who figure in the
life of Japanese national
heroes, mighty with the sword;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
apparitions, drunken men, wrestlers, street figures of every conceivable
description, mythical reptiles, snow-clad mountain tops, waving rice-fields
lashed by the wind, woodland glens, strange gateways of rock, far views
over waters with cliffs clothed with pine.</p>

<p>The most celebrated of those works which contain landscapes exclusively
are the views, published in three volumes in 1834-36, of the mountain of Fuji,
the great volcano rising close by Yeddo, and from old time playing a part in
the works of Japanese landscape painters. In Hokusai&rsquo;s book the cone of
the mountain is sometimes seen rising clear in a cloudless sky, whilst it is
sometimes shrouded by clouds of various shapes. Its beautiful outline glimmers
through the meshes of a net, through the spindrift of snow falling in great
flakes, or through a curtain of rain splashing vertically down. It rises from
misty valleys coloured by the rays of the evening sun, or is reflected&mdash;itself
out of sight&mdash;in the smooth surface of a lake, upon the reedy shores of which
the wild geese cackle, or it stands in ghostly outlines against the night sky
flooded with silver moonlight. Summer breezes and winter storms drive
over it, rattling showers of hail, lashed by the wind, or light falls of snow
descend round it. In spring the blossoms of peach and plum-trees flutter to
the earth, like swarms of white and rosy butterflies. Only famished wolves
or dragons, which popular superstition has located in the mountain of Fuji,
occasionally animate the grandiose solitude of the landscape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; says Gonse, &ldquo;has a more dexterous hand rested upon paper.
It is impossible to study his plates without an excited feeling of pleasure, for
they are absolute perfection, the highest that Japanese art has produced in
freshness, brilliancy, life, and originality. Hokusai&rsquo;s capacity of giving the
impression of relief and colour with a stroke of the brush has nothing like it
except in Rembrandt, Callot, and Goya. Men, animals, landscapes, and everything
in his drawings are reduced to their simplest expression. Groups are
seen in motion, priests in procession, soldiers on the march, and often a single
stroke is sufficient to render an individual or create the impression of life and
movement. Every plate is a masterpiece of coloured woodcut engraving, of
singular flavour in colour, delightful in its gravely harmonised chord of golden
yellow, faded green, and fiery red, to which are sometimes added golden, silvern,
and other metallic tones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the beginning of the sixties Paris came under the captivating influence
of Japan. And there is no doubt that as the English influenced the landscape
painters of Fontainebleau, the Venetians Delacroix, and the Neapolitan masters
Courbet and Ribot, the newest phase of French art, which took its departure
from Manet, was inaugurated by the enthusiasm for things Japanese. From
the moment when the peculiar isolation of Japan was ended by the breaking
up of the Japanese feudal state, Paris was flooded by splendid works of Japanese
art. A painter discovered amongst the mass of articles newly arrived albums,
colour prints, and pictures. Their drawing, colouring, and composition
deviated from everything hitherto accounted as art, and yet the æsthetic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
character of these works was too artistic to permit of any one smiling over
them as curiosities. Whether the discoverer was Alfred Stevens or Diaz,
Fortuny, James Tissot, or Alphonse Legros, the enthusiasm for the Japanese
swept over the studios like a storm. The artistic world never wearied of
admiring the capricious ability of these compositions, the astonishing power
of drawing, the fineness in tone, the originality of pictorial effect, nor of wondering
at the refined simplicity of the means by which these results were achieved.
Japanese art made itself felt by its fresh and tender charm, its creative opulence,
its lightness and delicacy of observation; it arrested attention because directness,
unfailing tact, and inherent distinction were of the essence of its conception;
and it was recognised as the production of a nation of artists combining
the subtilised taste of an originally refined civilisation with the freshness
of feeling peculiar to primitive people. Colour prints, now to be had for a
few francs at every bazaar, were bought at the highest figures. Every new
consignment was awaited with feverish impatience. Old ivory, enamel,
porcelain and embellished pottery, bronzes and wood and lacquer-work,
ornamented stuffs, embroidered silks, albums, books of wood-cuts, and knick-knacks
were scarcely unpacked in the shop before they found their way into
the studios of artists and the libraries of scholars. In a short time great
collections of the artistic productions
of Japan passed
into the hands of the painters
Manet, James Tissot, Whistler,
Fantin-Latour, Degas, Carolus
Duran, and Monet; of the
engravers Bracquemond and
Jules Jacquemart; of the
authors Edmond and Jules
de Goncourt, Champfleury,
Philippe Burty, and Zola;
and of the manufacturers
Barbedienne and Christofle.</p>

<p>The International Exhibition
of 1867 brought Japan
still more into fashion, and
from this year must be dated
the peculiar influence of the
West upon the East and the
East upon the West. The
Japanese came over to study
at the European polytechnic
institutes, universities, and
military academies. On the
other hand, we became the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
pupils of the Japanese in art. Even during the course of the Exhibition
a group of artists and critics founded a Japanese society of the &ldquo;Jinglar,&rdquo;
which met every week in Sèvres at the house of Solon, the director of
the manufactory. They used a Japanese dinner-service, designed by
Bracquemond, and everything except the napkins, cigars, and ash-trays
was Japanese. One of the members, Dr. Zacharias Astruc, published in
<i>L&rsquo;Étendard</i> a series of articles upon &ldquo;The Empire of the Rising Sun,&rdquo;
which made a great sensation. Soon afterwards the Parisian theatres
brought out Japanese ballets and fairy plays. Ernest d&rsquo;Hervilly wrote his
Japanese piece <i>La Belle Saïnara</i>, which Lemère printed for him in Japanese
fashion and paged from right to left, giving it a yellow cover designed
by Bracquemond. A Japanese ballet was performed at the opera, and a
Japanese turn was given to the toilettes of women.</p>

<p>For painters Japanese art was a revelation. Here was uttered the word that
hovered on so many lips, and that no one had dared to pronounce. With
what a fleeting touch, and yet with what precision, with what incomparable
sureness, lightness, and grace, was everything carried out. How intuitive
and spontaneous, how imaginative and how full of suggestion, how effortless
and how rich in surprises, was this strange art. How happily was industry
united with caprice, and nonchalance with endeavour at the highest finish.
How suggestive was this disregard for symmetry, this piquant method of
introducing a flower, an insect, a frog, or a bird here and there, merely as a
pictorial spot in the picture. How the Japanese understood the art of expressing
much with few means, where the Europeans toiled with a great expenditure
of means to express little.</p>

<p>It would certainly have been an exceedingly false move if a direct imitation
of the Japanese had been thought of. Japanese art is the product of a sensuous
people, and European art that of intellectual nations. The latter is greater
and more serious; it is nobler, and it reaches heights of expression not attained
by the grotesque and terrible distortions and the morbidly droll or melancholy
outbursts of sentiment known to the Japanese. Our imagination is alien to
that of these children of the sensuous world, who quake and tremble for joy,
horrify themselves with their masks, and pass from convulsive laughter to
sheer terror, and from the shudder of hallucination to ecstatic bliss. Had
Japanese art been coarsely transposed by imitators it would have led to
caricature.</p>

<p>But if its poetics were little suitable for Europe in the specialised case,
they nevertheless contained general laws better fitted for modern art than those
which had been hitherto borrowed from Greece. All arts, music as well as
poetry, were then striving for the dissolution of simple, tyrannical rhythms.
The recurrence of unyielding measures beaten out with unwavering repetition
no longer corresponded with the complicated, neurotic emotions of the new age.
In painting, likewise, exertions were being made to burst the old shell, and a
style was sought after for the treatment of modern life which had been violently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>
handled in the effort to force it to fit the Procrustean bed of traditional rules.
Then came the Japanese with their astonishing, rapid, and pictorial sketches,
and revealed a new method for the interpretation of nature. At a time when
the symmetrical balance of lines, borrowed from the works of the Renaissance
masters, became wearisome in its monotony, they taught a much freer architecture
of form, and one which was broken by charming caprices. Where there
had been rhythm, tension, clarity, largeness, and quietude in the old European
painting, there was in them a nervous freedom, an artful carelessness, and
life and charm. Art was concealed beneath the fancy shown in their facile
construction, which seemed to have been improvised by nature herself. An
artistic method of deviating from geometrical arrangement, freedom of distribution,
unforced and unsymmetrical structure, in the place of balance and
construction according to rules, were learnt from the Japanese in the matter of
composition.</p>

<p>At the same time, they threw light upon what had been flat and trivial in
Courbet&rsquo;s realism. These spirited narrators never told a story for the sake of
telling it; they never painted to give a prosaic copy of some particle of reality.
They liberated European painting from the heaviness of matter, and rendered
it tender and delicate. They taught that art of not saying everything, which
says so much, the method of compendious drawing, the secret of expanding
distance by a special treatment of lines, the touch thrown rapidly in, the
unforeseen, the surprise, the fleeting hint, the way of increasing effect by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span>
incompletion of motive, the suggestion of the whole by a part. Artists learnt
from them another manner of drawing and modelling, a manner of giving the
impression of the object without the need for the whole of it being executed,
so that one knows that it is there only through one&rsquo;s knowledge. They
brought in the taste for pithy sketches dealing only with essentials, the consciousness
of the endless catalogue of what may be contained&mdash;in life, reality,
and fancy&mdash;by one fluent outline. They introduced the preference for perspective
bird&rsquo;s-eye views, the disposition to throw groups, dense masses, and
crowds more into the distance, and render them more animated and vivid
by a relief of the foreground, which (though confirmed by photography) is
apparently improbable.</p>

<p>The influence of Japan on colouring is just as visible as upon composition
and drawing. It had been clearly shown in Courbet&rsquo;s pictures of artisans that
the rules of the Bolognese school, with their brown sauce and their red shadows,
could not possibly be applied to objects in the open air. It was therefore
necessary to discover a new principle of colour for modern subjects, a principle
by which oil-painting would be divested of its oil, and light and air would come
to their rights. It was seen from the works of the painters of Nippon that it was
not absolutely necessary to paint brown to be a painter. They taught a new
method of seeing things, opened the eyes to the changing play of the phenomena
of light, the fugitive nature and constant mutability of which had up to this
time seemed to mock at every rendering. The softness of their bright harmonies
was studied and artistically transposed.</p>

<p>These are the points in which Japanese art has had a revolutionary effect
upon the development of European. Each one of those who at that time
belonged to the Society of the Jinglar has had more or less experience of its
influence. Alfred Stevens owes to it certain delicacies of colouring; Whistler,
his exquisite refinement of tone and his capriciously artistic method in the
treatment of landscape; Degas, his fantastic and free grouping, his unrivalled
audacities of composition. Manet especially became now the artist to whom
history does honour, and Louis Gonse tells a story with a very characteristic
touch of the first exhibition of the <i>Maîtres impressionistes</i>. He went there,
coming from the official Salon in the company of a Japanese, and, while the
French public declared the fresh brightness of the pictures to be untrue and
barbaric, the son of sacred Nippon, accustomed from youth to see nature in
light, airy tones without a yellow coating of varnish, said: &ldquo;Over there I was
in an exhibition of oil-pictures, here I feel as if I were entering a flowery garden.
What strikes me is the animation of these figures, and the feeling is one I have
never had elsewhere in your picture exhibitions.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XXXI</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE IMPRESSIONISTS</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> name Impressionists dates from an exhibition in Paris which was
got up at Nadar&rsquo;s in 1871. The catalogue contained a great deal
about impressions&mdash;for instance, &ldquo;<i>Impression de mon pot au feu</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Impression
d&rsquo;un chat qui se promène</i>.&rdquo; In his criticism Claretie summed up
the impressions and spoke of the <i>Salon des Impressionistes</i>.</p>

<p>The beginning of the movement, however, came about the middle of the
sixties, and Zola was the first to champion the new artists with his trenchant
pen. Assuming the name of his later hero Claude, he contributed in 1866 to
<i>L&rsquo;Événement</i>, under the title <i>Mon Salon</i>, that article which swamped the
office with such a flood of indignant letters and occasioned such a secession
of subscribers that the proprietor of the paper, the sage and admirable M. de
Villemessant, felt himself obliged to give the naturalist critic an anti-naturalistic
colleague in the person of M. Théodore Pelloquet. In these reviews of
the Salon, collected in 1879 in the volume <i>Mes Haines</i>, and in the essay upon
<i>Courbet, the Painter of Realism</i>&mdash;Courbet, the already recognised &ldquo;master
of Ornans &ldquo;&mdash;those theories are laid down which Lantier and his friends
announced at a later date in <i>L&rsquo;&OElig;uvre</i>. Then the architect Dubiche, one of
the members of the young <i>Bohème</i>, dreamed in a spirit of presage of a new
architecture. &ldquo;With passionate gestures he demanded and insisted upon
the formula for the architecture of this democracy, that work in stone which
should give expression to it, a building in which it should feel itself at home,
something strong and forcible, simple and great, something already proclaimed
in our railway stations and our markets in the grace and power of their iron
girders, but purified and made beautiful, declaring the largeness of our conquests.&rdquo;
A few years went by, and then the Paris Centenary Exhibition
provided that something, though it was not in monumental stone. The
great edifices were fashioned of glass and iron, and the mighty railway buildings
were their forerunners. The enormous engine-rooms which gave space
for thousands and the Eiffel Tower announced this new architecture. And
as Dubiche prophesied a new architecture, so did Claude prophesy a new
painting. &ldquo;Sun and open air and bright and youthful painting are what
we need. Let the sun come in and render objects as they appear under the
illumination of broad daylight.&rdquo; In Zola Claude Lantier is the martyr of
this new style. He is scorned, derided, avoided, and cast out. His best picture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>
is smuggled, through grace and mercy, into the Exhibition by a friend upon
the hanging committee as a <i>charité</i>. But, ten years after, these new doctrines
had penetrated all the studios of Paris and of Europe like germs borne in the
air.</p>

<p>The artistic ideas of Claude Lantier were given to Zola by his friend
<i>Édouard Manet</i>, the father of Impressionism, and in that way the creator
of the newest form of art. Manet appeared for the first time in 1862. In
1865, when the Committee of the Salon gave up a few secondary rooms to
the rejected, the first of his pictures which made any sensation were to be
seen&mdash;a &ldquo;Scourging of Christ&rdquo; and a picture of a girl with a cat resting&mdash;both
invariably surrounded by a dense circle of the scornful. Forty years before,
the first works of the Romanticists, whose doctrine was likewise scoffed at in
the formula <i>Le laid c&rsquo;est le beau</i>, had called forth a similar outcry against
the want of taste common to them all. A generation later people laughed
at &ldquo;The Funeral in Ornans,&rdquo; and now the same derision was directed against
Manet, who completed Courbet&rsquo;s work. His pictures were held to be a practical
joke which the painter was playing upon the public, the most unheard
of farce that had ever been painted. If any one had declared that these
works would give the impulse to a revolution in art, people would have turned
their backs upon him or thought that he was jesting. &ldquo;Criticism treated
Manet,&rdquo; wrote Zola, &ldquo;as a kind of buffoon who put out his tongue for the
amusement of street boys.&rdquo; The rage against &ldquo;The Scourging of Christ&rdquo;
went so far that the picture had to be protected by special precautions from
the assaults of sticks and umbrellas.</p>

<p>But the matter took a somewhat different aspect when, five years afterwards,
from twenty to thirty more recent pictures were exhibited together
in Manet&rsquo;s studio. Whether it was because the aims of the painter had
become clearer in the meanwhile, or because his works suffered less from
the proximity of others, they made an impression, and that although they
represented nothing in the least adventurous and sensational. Life-size
figures, light and almost without shadow, rowed over blue water, hung out
white linen, watered green flower-pots, and leant against grey walls. The
light colours placed immediately beside each other had a bizarre effect on
the eye accustomed to chiaroscuro. The eye, which, like the human spirit,
has its habitudes, and believes that it always sees nature as she is painted,
was irritated by these delicately chosen tone-values which seemed to it
arbitrary, by these novel harmonies which it took for discords. Nevertheless
the clarity of the pictures made a striking effect, and something of
&ldquo;Manet&rsquo;s sun&rdquo; lingered in the memory. People still laughed, only not so
loud, and they gave Manet credit for having the courage of his convictions.
&ldquo;A remarkable circumstance has to be recorded. A young painter has
followed his personal impressions quite ingenuously, and has painted a few
things which are not altogether in accord with the principles taught in the
schools. In this way he has executed pictures which have been a source
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>
of offence to eyes accustomed to other paintings. But now, instead of abusing
the young artist through thick and thin, we must be first clear as to why our
eyes have been offended, and whether they ought to have been.&rdquo; With these
words criticism began to take Manet seriously. Charles Ephrussi and Duranty,
besides Zola, came forward as his first literary champions in the press.
&ldquo;Manet is bold&rdquo; was now the phrase used about him in public. The Impressionists
took the salon by storm. And Manet&rsquo;s bright and radiant sun
was seen to be a better thing than the brown sauce of the Bolognese. It was
as if a strong power had suddenly deranged the focus of opinion in all the
studios, and Manet&rsquo;s victory brought the same salvation to French art as
that of Delacroix had done forty years before and that of Courbet ten years
before. <i>Manet et manebit.</i> Delacroix, Courbet, and Manet are the three
great names of modern French painting, the names of the men who gave
it the most decisive impulses.</p>

<p>Édouard Manet, <i>le maître impressioniste</i>, was born in 1832, in the Rue
Bonaparte, exactly opposite the École des Beaux-Arts, and his life was quietly
and simply spent, without
passion and excitement,
unusual events, or
sanguinary battles. At
sixteen, having passed
through the <i>Collège Rollin</i>,
he entered the navy
with the permission of
his parents, and made a
voyage to Rio de Janeiro,
which was accomplished
without any incident of
interest, without shipwreck
or any one being
drowned. With his cheerful,
even temperament
he looked on the boundless
sea and satiated his
eyes with the marvellous
spectacle of waves and
horizon, never to forget
it. The luminous sky
was spread before him,
the great ocean rocked
and sported around, revealing
colours other than
he had seen in the Salon.
On his return he gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span>
himself up entirely to painting. He is said to have been a slight, pale, delicate,
and refined young man when he became a pupil of Couture in 1851, almost at
the same time as Feuerbach. Nearly six years he remained with the master of
&ldquo;The Decadent Romans,&rdquo; without a suspicion of how he was to find his way,
and even after he had left the studio he was still pursued by the shade of
Couture; he worked without knowing very well what he really wanted. Then
he travelled, visiting Germany, Cassel, Dresden, Prague, Vienna, and Munich,
where he copied the portrait of Rembrandt in the Pinakothek; and then he
saw Florence, Rome, and Venice. Under the influence of the Neapolitan and
Flemish artists, to whom Ribot, Courbet, and Stevens pointed at the time, he
gradually became a painter. His first picture, &ldquo;The Child with Cherries,&rdquo;
painted in 1859, reveals the influence of Brouwer. In 1861 he exhibited,
for the first time, the &ldquo;double portrait&rdquo; of his parents, for which he received
honourable mention, although&mdash;or because&mdash;the picture was entirely painted
in the old Bolognese style. These works are only of interest because they
make it possible to see the rapidity with which Manet learnt to understand
his craft with the aid of the old masters,
and the sureness and energy with which
he followed, from the very beginning,
the realistic tendency initiated by
Courbet. &ldquo;The Nymph Surprised,&rdquo;
in 1862, was a medley of reminiscences
from Jordaens, Tintoretto, and Delacroix.
His &ldquo;Old Musician,&rdquo; executed
with diligence but trivial in its realism,
had the appearance of being a tolerable
Courbet. Then he made&mdash;not at first
in Madrid, which he only knew later,
but in the Louvre&mdash;the eventful discovery
of another old master, not yet
known in all his individuality to the
master of Ornans.</p>

<p>At the great Manchester Exhibition
of 1857 Velasquez had been revealed
to the English; in the beginning of the
sixties he was discovered by the French.
William Stirling&rsquo;s biography of Velasquez
was translated into French by G.
Brunet, and provided with a <i>Catalogue
raisonné</i> by W. Bürger. The works of
Charles Blanc, Théophile Gautier, and
Paul Lefort appeared, and in a short
time Velasquez, of whom the world outside
Madrid had hitherto known little,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>109</span>
was in artistic circles in Paris a
familiar and frequently cited personality,
who began not only to occupy
the attention of the historians of art,
but of artists also. Couture was in
the habit of saying to his pupils that
Velasquez had not understood the
orchestration of tones, that he had
an inclination to monochrome, and
that he had never comprehended
the nature of colour. From the
beginning of the sixties France came
under the sway of that serious feeling
for colour known to the great
Spaniard, and Manet was his first
enthusiastic pupil. Certain of his
single figures against a pearl-grey
background&mdash;&ldquo;The Fifer,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Guitarero,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Bull-fighter
wounded to Death&rdquo;&mdash;were the decisive
works in which, with astonishing
talent, he declared himself as the pupil of Velasquez. W. Bürger
praised Velasquez as <i>le peintre le plus peintre qui fût jamais</i>. As regards
the nineteenth century, the same may be said of Manet. Only Frans
Hals and Velasquez had these eminent pictorial qualities. In the way
in which the black velvet dress, the white silk band, and the red flag were
painted in the toreador picture, there was a feeling for beauty which bore
witness to the finest understanding of the great Spaniard. In his &ldquo;Angels at
the Tomb of Christ&rdquo; he has sought, as little as did Velasquez in his picture
of the Epiphany, to introduce any trace of heavenly expression into the faces,
but as a piece of painting it takes its place amongst the best religious pictures of
the century. His &ldquo;Bon Bock&rdquo;&mdash;a portrait of the engraver Belot, a stout jovial
man smoking a pipe as he sits over a glass of beer&mdash;is one of those likenesses
which stamp themselves upon the memory like the &ldquo;Hille Bobbe&rdquo; of Frans
Hals. &ldquo;Faure as Hamlet&rdquo; stands out from the vacant light grey background
like the &ldquo;Truhan Pablillos&rdquo; of Velasquez. The doublet and mantle are of
black velvet, the mantle lined with rose-coloured silk; and the toilette is
completed by a broad black hat with a large black feather. He seems as
though he had just stepped to the footlights, and stands there with his legs
apart, the mantle thrown over the left arm, and his right hand closing upon
his sword. The cool harmony of black, white, grey, and rose-colour makes an
uncommonly refined effect. Manet has the rich artistic methods of Velasquez
in a measure elsewhere only attained by Raeburn, and as the last of these
studies he has created in his &ldquo;Enfant à l&rsquo;Épée&rdquo; a work which&mdash;speaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
without profanity&mdash;might have been signed by the great Spaniard himself.
In the beginning of the sixties, when he gave a separate exhibition of his works,
Courbet is said to have exclaimed upon entering, &ldquo;Nothing but Spaniards!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But even this following of the Spaniards indicated an advance upon Courbet;
it meant the triumph over brown sauce and a closer approximation to truth.
For, amongst all the old masters, Velasquez and Frans Hals&mdash;who greatly
resemble each other in this respect&mdash;are the simplest and most natural in their
colouring; they are not idealists in colour like Titian, Paul Veronese, and
Rubens, nor do they labour upon the tone of their pictures like the Dutch
&ldquo;little masters&rdquo; and Chardin. They paint their pictures in the broad and
common light of day. Their flesh-tint is truer than the juicy tint of the
Venetians, and the fiery red of Rubens, with his shining reflections. Beside
Velasquez, as Justi says, the colouring of Titian seems conventional, that of
Rembrandt fantastic, and that of Rubens is tinged with something which is
not natural. Or, as a contemporary of Velasquez expressed himself: &ldquo;Everything
else, old and new, is painting; Velasquez alone is truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the difference between the youthful works of Manet and
those of his predecessor Courbet is the difference between Velasquez and
Caravaggio. Of course, in Manet&rsquo;s earliest pictures there were found the
broad, dull red-brown surfaces which characterise the works of the
Bolognese and the Neapolitans. A cool silver tone, a shadowless treatment
gleaming in silver, has
now taken the place of this
warm brown sauce. He has
the white of Velasquez, his
cool subdued rose-colour, his
delicate grey which has been
so much admired and against
which every touch of colour
stands out clear and determined,
and that celebrated
black of the Spaniard which
is never heavy and dull, but
makes such a light and transparent
effect. What is bright
is contrasted with what is
bright, and light colours are
placed upon a silvery grey
background. The most perfect
modelling and plastic
effect is attained without the
aid of strong contrasts of
shadow. Thus he closed his
apprenticeship to the old
masters by being able to see with the eyes of that old master whose vision
was the truest.</p>

<p>This was the point of departure for Manet&rsquo;s further development. The
study of Velasquez did not merely set him free from sauce; it also started
the problem of painting light. He went through a course of development
similar to that of the old Spaniard himself. When Velasquez painted his
first picture with a popular turn, the &ldquo;Bacchus,&rdquo; he still stood upon the
ground of the tenebrous painters; he represented an open-air scene with the
illumination of a closed room. Although the ceremony is taking place in
broad daylight, the people seem to be sitting in a dingy tavern, receiving
light from a studio window to the left. Ten years afterwards, when he painted
&ldquo;The Smithy of Vulcan,&rdquo; he had emancipated himself from this Bolognese
tradition, which he spoke of henceforward as &ldquo;a gloomy and horrible style.&rdquo;
The deep and sharply contrasted shadows have vanished, and daylight has
conquered the light of the cellar. The great equestrian portraits which followed
gave Mengs occasion to remark, even a hundred years ago, that Velasquez
was the first who understood how to paint what is &ldquo;ambiant,&rdquo; the air filling
the vacuum between objects. And at the end of his life he solved the final
problem in &ldquo;The Women Spinning.&rdquo; In the &ldquo;Bacchus&rdquo; might be found
the treatment of an open-air scene in the key of sauce, but here was the glistening
of light in an interior. The sun quivers over silken stuffs, falls upon the
dazzling necks of women, plays through coal-black Castilian locks, renders one
thing plastically distinct and another pictorially vague, dissolves corporeality,
and lends surface the rounding of life. Contours touched with the brightness
of light surround the heads of the girls at work. The shadows are not warm
brown but cool grey, and the tints of reflected light play from one object to
another.</p>

<p>Two remarkable pictures of 1863 and 1865 show that Manet had grasped
the problem and was endeavouring in a tentative way to give expression to
his ideas.</p>

<p>In one of these, &ldquo;The Picnic,&rdquo; painted in 1863, there was a stretch of
sward, a few trees, and in the background a river in which a woman was
merrily splashing in her chemise; in the foreground were seated two young
men in frock-coats opposite another woman, who has just come out of the
water and been drying herself. Needless to say, this picture was rejected
as something unprecedented, by the committee, which included Ingres, Léon
Cogniet, Robert Fleury, and Hippolyte Flandrin. Eugène Delacroix was
the only one in its favour. So Manet was relegated to the <i>Salon des Refusés</i>,
where Bracquemond, Legros, Whistler, and Harpignies were hung beside
him. This Exhibition was held in the Industrial Hall, and the public went
through a narrow little door from one gallery to the other. Half Paris was
bewildered and discomposed by these works of the rejected; even Napoleon
<span class="sc">III</span> and the Empress Eugénie ostentatiously turned their backs upon Manet&rsquo;s
picture when they visited the Salon. This naked woman made a scandal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
How shocking! A woman without the slightest stitch of clothes between two
gentlemen in their frock-coats! In the Louvre, indeed, there were about
fifty Venetian paintings with much the same purport. Every manual of art
refers to &ldquo;The Family,&rdquo; as it is called, and the &ldquo;Ages of Life&rdquo; of Giorgione,
in which nude and clothed figures are moving in a landscape and placed ingenuously
beside each other. But that a painter should claim for a modern
artist the right of painting for the joy of what is purely pictorial was a
phenomenon that had never been encountered before. The public searched
for something obscene, and they found it; but for Manet the whole picture was
only a technical experiment: the nude woman in front was only there because
the painter wanted to observe the play of the sun and the reflections of the
foliage upon naked flesh; the woman in her chemise merely owed her existence
to the circumstance of her charming outline making such a delightful patch
of white amid the green meadows. Manet for the first time touched the
problem which Madox Brown had thrown out in his &ldquo;Work&rdquo; ten years before
in England, though for the present he did so with no greater success: the
sunbeams glanced no doubt, but they were heavy and opaque; the sky was
bright, but without atmosphere. As yet there is nothing of the Manet who
belongs to history.</p>

<p>The celebrated &ldquo;Olympia&rdquo; of 1865, now to be found in the Luxembourg,
was painted during this stage in his development: it represents a neurotic,
anæmic creature, who stretches out, pale and sickly, her meagre nudity upon
white linen, with a purring cat at her feet; whilst a negress in a red dress
draws back the curtain, offering
her a bouquet. With this picture&mdash;no
one can tell why&mdash;the
definite battles over Impressionism
began. The critics who
talked about obscenity were not
consistent, because Titian&rsquo;s pictures
of Venus with her female
attendant, the little dog, and
the youth sitting upon the edge
of the bed, are not usually held
to be obscene. But it is nevertheless
difficult to find in this
flatly modelled body, with its
hard black outlines, those artistic
qualities which Zola discovered
in it. The picture has nothing
whatever of Titian in it, but it
may almost be said to have
something of Cranach. &ldquo;The
Picnic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Olympia&rdquo; have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span>
both only an historical interest as the first works in which the artist
trusted his own eyes, refusing to look through any one&rsquo;s spectacles.
Feeling that he would come to nothing if he continued to study nature
through the medium of an old master, he had to render some real thing
just as it appeared to him when he was not looking into the mirror of old
pictures. He tried to forget what he had studied in galleries, the tricks of
art which he had learnt with Couture, and the famous pictures he had seen.
In his earlier works there had been a far-fetched refinement and a delicacy
taken from the old masters, but &ldquo;The Picnic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Olympia&rdquo; are simpler
and more independent. In both he was already an &ldquo;Impressionist,&rdquo; true
to his personal vision, though he could not entirely express the new language
that hovered upon his lips. He had tried both to rid himself of Courbet&rsquo;s
brown sauce and of the ivory tone of Bouguereau, and to be just to local tones
through simple and independent observation; in his &ldquo;Picnic&rdquo; he had painted
the trees green, the earth yellow, and the sky grey, and in &ldquo;Olympia&rdquo; the
bed white and the body of the woman flesh-colour. But he was as little
successful as the pre-Raphaelites in bringing the local tones into full harmony.
This is the step which Manet made in advance of the pre-Raphaelites: after
he had emancipated himself from the conventional brown and ivory scheme
of tone, and had been for a time, like the pre-Raphaelites, true although hard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
he attained that harmony which hitherto had been either not reached by
artistic means or not reached at all, by strict observation of the medium by
which nature produces her harmonies&mdash;light. As the air, the pervasive
atmosphere, renders nature everywhere harmonious and refined in colour, so
it forthwith became for the artist the means of reaching that great harmony
which is the object of all pictorial endeavour, and which had never previously
been reached except through some mannerism.</p>

<p>This movement, so historically memorable, when Manet discovered the
sun and the fine fluid of the atmosphere, was shortly before 1870. Not long
before the declaration of war he was in the country, in the neighbourhood
of Paris, staying with his friend de Nittis; but he continued to work
as though he were at home, only his studio was here the pleasure-ground.
Here one day he sat in full sunlight, placed his model amid
the flowers of the turf, and began to paint. The result was &ldquo;The Garden,&rdquo;
now in the possession of Madame de Nittis. The young wife of the
Italian painter is reclining in an easy-chair, between her husband, who
is lying on the grass, and her child asleep in its cradle. Every flower
is fresh and bright upon the fragrant sward. The green of the stretch
of grass is luminous, and everything is bathed in soft, bright atmosphere;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
the leaves cast their blue shadows upon the yellow gravel path. &ldquo;Plein-air&rdquo;
made its entry into painting.</p>

<p>In 1870 his activity had to be interrupted. He entered a company of
Volunteers consisting chiefly of artists and men of letters, and in December
he became a lieutenant in the Garde Nationale, where he had Meissonier as
his colonel. The pictures, therefore, in which he was entirely Manet belong
exclusively to the period following 1870.</p>

<p>From this time his great problem was the sun, the glow of daylight, the
tremor of the air upon the earth basking in light. He became a natural
philosopher who could never satisfy himself, studying the effect of light and
determining with the observation of a man of science how the atmosphere
alters the phenomena of colour.</p>

<p>In tender, virginal, light grey tones, never seen before, he depicted, in
fourteen pictures exhibited at a dealer&rsquo;s, the luxury and grace of Paris, the
bright days of summer and <i>soirées</i> flooded with gaslight, the faded features
of the fallen maiden and the refined <i>chic</i> of the woman of the world. There
was to be seen &ldquo;Nana,&rdquo; that marvel of audacious grace. Laced in a blue silk
corset, and otherwise clad
merely in a muslin smock with
her feet in pearl-grey stockings,
the blond woman stands at the
mirror painting her lips, and
carelessly replying to the words
of a man who is watching her
upon the sofa behind. Near
it hung balcony scenes, fleeting
sketches from the skating
rink, the <i>café concert</i>, the <i>Bal
de l&rsquo;Opéra</i>, the <i>déjeuner</i> scene
at Père Lathuille&rsquo;s, and the
&ldquo;Bar at the Folies-Bergères.&rdquo;
In one case he has made daylight
the subject of searching
study, in another the artificial
illumination of the footlights.
&ldquo;Music in the Tuileries&rdquo; reveals
a crowd of people swarming
in an open, sunny place.
Every figure was introduced
as a patch of colour, but these
patches were alive and this
multitude spoke. One of the
best pictures was &ldquo;Boating&rdquo;&mdash;a
craft boldly cut away in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span>
frame, after the manner of the Japanese, and seated in it a young lady in light
blue and a young man in white, their figures contrasting finely with the
delicate grey of the water and the atmosphere impregnated with moisture.
And scattered amongst these pictures there were to be found powerful sea-pieces
and charming, piquant portraits.</p>

<p>Manet had a passion for the world. He was a man with a slight and
graceful figure, a beard of the colour known as <i>blond cendré</i>, deep blue eyes
filled with the fire of youth, a refined, clever face, aristocratic hands, and a
manner of great urbanity. With his wife, the highly cultured daughter of a
Dutch musician, he went into the best circles of Parisian society, and was
popular everywhere for his trenchant judgment and his sparkling intellect.
His conversation was vivid and sarcastic. He was famous for his wit <i>à la</i>
Gavarni. He delighted in the delicate perfume of drawing-rooms, the shining
candle-light at receptions; he worshipped modernity and the piquant <i>frou-frou</i>
of toilettes; he was the first who stood with both feet in the world which
seemed so inartistic to others. Thus the progress made in the acquisition
of subject and material may be seen even in the outward appearance of the
three pioneers of modern art. Millet in his portrait stands in wooden shoes,
Courbet in his shirt-sleeves; Manet wears a tall hat and a frock-coat. Millet,
the peasant, painted peasants. Courbet, the democrat from the provinces,
gave the rights of citizenship to the artisan, but without himself deserting
the provinces and the <i>bourgeoisie</i>. He was repelled by everything either
distinguished or refined. In such matters he could not find the force and
vehemence which were all he sought. Manet, the Parisian and the man of
refinement, gave art the elegance of modern life.</p>

<p>In the year 1879 he made the Parisian magistracy the offer of painting in
the session-room of the Town Hall the entire <i>Ventre de Paris</i>, the markets,
railway stations, lading-places, and public gardens, and beneath the ceiling a
gallery of the celebrated men of the present time. His letter was unanswered,
and yet it gave the impulse to all those great pictures of contemporary life
painted afterwards in Paris and the provinces for the walls of public buildings.
In 1880 he received, through the exertions of his friend Antonin Proust, a
medal of the second class, the only one ever awarded to him. And the dealer
Duret began to buy pictures from him; Durand-Ruel followed suit, and so
did M. Faure, the singer of the Grand Opera, who himself is the owner of five-and-thirty
Manets. The poor artist did not long enjoy this recognition. On
30th April 1883, the varnishing day at the Salon, he died from blood-poisoning
and the consequences of the amputation of a leg.</p>

<p>But the seed which he had scattered had already thrown out roots. It
had taken him years to force open the doors of the Salon, but to-day his name
shines in letters of gold upon the façade of the École des Beaux-Arts as that
of the man who has spoken the most decisive final utterance on behalf of the
liberation of modern art. His achievement, which seems to have been an
unimportant alteration in the method of painting, was in reality a renovation
in the method of looking at the world and a renovation in the method of
thinking.</p>

<p>Up to this time it was only the landscape painters who had emancipated
themselves from imitation of the gallery tone, and what was done by Corot
in landscape had, logically enough, to be carried out in figure-painting likewise;
for men and women are encompassed by the air as much as trees. After the
landscape painters of Barbizon had made evident the vast difference between
the light of day and that of a closed room in their pictures painted in the open
air, the figure-painters, if they made any claim to truth of effect, could no
longer venture to content themselves with the illumination falling upon their
models in the studio, when they were painting incidents taking place out of
doors. Yet even the boldest of the new artists did not set themselves free
from tradition. Even after they had become independent in subject and
composition they had remained the slaves of the old masters in their intuition
of colour. Some imitated the Spaniards, without reflecting that Ribera painted
his pictures in a small, dark studio, and that the cellar-light with which they
were illuminated was therefore correct, whereas applied, in the present age,
to the bright interiors of the nineteenth
century it was utterly false. Others treated
open-air scenes as if they were taking place
in a ground-floor parlour, and endeavoured
by curtains and shutters to create a light
similar to that which may be found in old
masters and pictures dimmed with age. Or
the artist painted according to a general
recipe and in complete defiance of what he
saw with his eyes. For instance, an exceedingly
characteristic episode is told of the
student days of Puvis de Chavannes.
Upon a grey, misty day the young artist
had painted a nude figure. The model
appeared enveloped in tender light as by
a bright, silvery halo. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way
you see your model?&rdquo; grumbled Couture
indignantly when he came to correct the
picture. Then he mixed together white,
cobalt blue, Naples yellow, and vermilion,
and turned Puvis de Chavannes&rsquo; nude grey
figure by a universal recipe into one that
was highly coloured and warmly luminous&mdash;such
a figure as an old master might
perhaps have painted under different conditions
of light. With his &ldquo;Fiat Lux&rdquo;
Manet uttered a word of redemption that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>
had hovered upon many lips. The jurisdiction of galleries was broken now
also in regard to colour; the last remnant of servile dependence upon the
mighty dead was cast aside; the aims attained by the landscape painters
thirty years before were reached in figure-painting likewise.</p>

<p>Perhaps a later age may even come to recognise that Manet made an
advance upon the old masters in his delicacy and scrupulous analysis of light;
in that case it will esteem the discovery of tone-values as the chief acquisition
of the nineteenth century, as a conquest such as has never been made in
painting since the Eycks and Masaccio, since the establishment of the theory of
perspective. In a treatise commanding all respect Hugo Magnus has written
of how the sense of colour increased in the various periods of the world&rsquo;s
history; since the appearance of the Impressionists, verification may be made
of yet another advance in this direction. The study of tone-values has never
been carried on with such conscientious exactitude, and in regard to truth of
atmosphere one is disposed to believe that our eyes to-day see and feel things
which our ancestors had not yet noticed. The old masters have also touched
the problem of &ldquo;truth in painting.&rdquo; It is not merely that the character of
their colours often led the Italian tempera and fresco painters to the most
natural method of treating light. They even occupied themselves in a theoretical
way with the question.  An old Italian precept declares that the painter
ought to work in a closed yard beneath an awning, but should place his model
beneath the open sky. In the frescoes which he painted in Arezzo in 1480,
Piero della Francesca, in particular, pursued the problem of <i>plein-air</i> painting
with a fine instinct. But love of the beautiful and luminous tints, such as
the technique of oil-painting enabled artists to attain at a later date, quickly
seduced them from carrying out the natural treatment of light in the gradation
of colour. Under the influence of oil-painting the Italians of the great period,
from Leonardo onwards, turned more and more to strong contrasts. And in
spite of Albert Cuyp, even the Dutch landscape painters of the seventeenth
century have seen objects rather in line and form, plastically, than pictorially
in their environment of light and air. The nineteenth century was the first
seriously to attack a problem which&mdash;except by Velasquez&mdash;had been merely
touched upon by the old schools, but never solved.</p>

<p>What the masters of Barbizon had done through instinctive genius was
made the object of scientific study by the Impressionists. The new school
set up the principle that atmosphere changes the colour of objects; for instance,
that the colour and outline of a tree painted in a room are completely different
from those of the same tree painted upon the spot in the open air. As an
unqualified rule they claimed that every incident was to be harmonised with
time, place, and light; thus a scene
taking place out of doors had of necessity
to be painted, not within four
walls, but under the actual illumination
of morning, or noon, or evening, or
night. In making this problem the
object of detailed and careful inquiry
the artist came to analyse life, throbbing
beneath its veil of air and light,
with more refinement and thoroughness
than the old masters had done. The
latter painted light deadened in its fall,
not shining. Oils were treated as an
opaque material, colour appeared to
be a substance, and the radiance of
tinted light was lost through this
material heaviness. Courbet still represented
merely the object apart from
its environment; he saw things in a
plastic way, and not as they were,
bathed in the atmosphere; his men
and women lived in oil, in brown sauce, and not where it was only possible
for them to live&mdash;in the air. Everything he painted he isolated without
a thought of atmospheric surroundings. Now a complete change of
parts was effected: bodies and colours were no longer painted, but the
shifting power of light under which everything changes form and colour at
every moment of the day. The elder painters in essentials confined light
to the surface of objects; the new painters believed in its universality, beholding
in it the father of all life and of the manifold nature of the visible
world, and therefore of colour also. They no longer painted colours and forms
with lights and cast-shadows, but pellucid light, pouring over forms and colours
and absorbed and refracted by them. They no longer looked merely to the
particular, but to the whole, no longer saw nothing except deadened light
and cast-shadows, but the harmony and pictorial charm of a moment of nature
considered as such. With a zeal which at times seemed almost paradoxical,
they proceeded to establish the importance of the phenomena of light. They
discovered that, so far from being gilded, objects are silvered by sunlight,
and they made every effort to analyse the multiplicity of these fine gradations
down to their most delicate <i>nuances</i>. They learnt to paint the quiver of tremulous
sunbeams radiating far and wide; they were the lyrical poets of light,
which they often glorified at the expense of what it envelops and causes to
live. At the service of art they placed a renovated treasury of refined, purified,
and pictorial phases of expression, in which the history of art records an
increase in the human eye of the sense of colour and the power of perception.</p>

<p>That light is movement is here made obvious, and that all life is movement
is just what their art reveals. Courbet was an admirable painter of plain
surfaces. If he had to paint a wall he took it upon his strong shoulders and
transferred it to his canvas in such a way that a stonemason might have been
deceived. If it was a question of rocks, the body of a woman, or the waves
of the sea, he began to mix his pigments thick, laid a firm mass of colour on
the canvas, and spread it with a knife. This spade-work gave him unrivalled
truth to nature in reproducing the surface of hard substances. Rocks, banks,
and walls look as they do in nature, but in the case of moving, indeterminate
things his power deserts him. His landscapes are painted in a rich, broad,
and juicy style, but his earth has no pulsation. Courbet has forgotten the
birds in his landscape. His seas have been seen with extraordinary largeness
of feeling, and they are masterpieces of drawing; the only drawback is that
they seem uninhabitable for fish. Under the steady hand of the master the
sea came to a standstill and was changed into rock. If he has to paint human
beings they stand as motionless as blocks of wood. The expression of their
faces seems galvanised into life, like their bodies. Placing absolute directness
in the rendering of impressions in their programme, as the chief aim of their
artistic endeavours, the Impressionists were the first to discover the secret
of seizing with the utmost freshness the <i>nuances</i> of expression and movement,
which remained petrified in the hands of their predecessors. Only the flash
of the spokes is painted in the wheel of a carriage in motion, and never the
appearance of the wheel when it is at rest; in the same way they allow the
outlines of human figures to relax and
become indistinct, to call up the impression
of movement, the real vividness
of the appearance. Colour has
been established as the sole, unqualified
medium of expression for the painter,
and has so absorbed the drawing that
the line receives, as it were, a pulsating
life, and cannot be felt except in a
pictorial way. In the painting of nude
human figures the waxen look&mdash;which
in the traditional painting from the
nude had a pretence of being natural&mdash;has
vanished from the skin, and
thousands of delicately distinguished
gradations give animation to the flesh.
Moreover, a finer and deeper observation
of temperament was made possible
by lighter and more sensitive technique.
In the works of the earlier <i>genre</i>
painters people never are what they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span>
are supposed to represent.
The hired model, picked from
the lower strata of life, and
used by the painter in bringing
his picture slowly to completion,
was obvious even in
the most elegant toilette; but
now real human beings are
represented, men and women
whose carriage, gestures, and
countenances tell at once
what they are. Even in portrait
painting people whom
the painter has surprised before
they have had time to
put themselves in order, at
the moment when they are
still entirely natural, have
taken the place of lay-figures
fixed in position. The effort
to seize the most unconstrained
air and the most
natural position, and to arrest
the most transitory shade of
expression, produces, in this field of art also, a directness and vivacity
divided by a great gulf from the pose and the grand airs of the earlier
drawing-room picture.</p>

<p>From his very first appearance there gathered round Manet a number of
young men who met twice a week at a café in Batignolles, formerly a suburb
at the entrance of the Avenue de Clichy. After this trysting-place the society
called itself <i>L&rsquo;École des Batignolles</i>. Burty, Antonin Proust, Henner, and
Stevens put in an occasional appearance, but Legros, Whistler, Fantin-Latour,
Duranty, and Zola were constant visitors. Degas, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley,
Monet, Gauguin, and Zandomeneghi were the leading spirits of the impressionistic
staff, and, being excluded from the official Salon, they generally set
up their tent at Nadar&rsquo;s, Reichshofen&rsquo;s, or some other dealer&rsquo;s. These are
the names of the men who, following Manet, were the earliest to make the
new problem the object of their studies.</p>

<p><i>Degas</i>, the subtle colourist and miraculous draughtsman, who celebrates
dancers, gauze skirts, and the <i>foyers</i> of the Opera, is the boldest and the most
original of those who banded together from the very outset of the movement&mdash;the
worst enemy of everything pretty and banal, the greatest dandy of
modern France, the man whose works are caviare to the general and so refreshing
to the <i>gourmet</i>, the painter who can find a joy in the sublime beauty of ugliness.</p>

<p>Degas was older than Manet. He had run through all phases of French
art since Ingres. His first pictures, &ldquo;Spartan Youths&rdquo; and &ldquo;Semiramis
building the Walls of Babylon,&rdquo; might indeed have been painted by Ingres,
to whom he looks up even now as to the first star in the firmament of French
art. Then for a time he was influenced by the suggestive and tender intimacy
in feeling and the soft, quiet harmony of Chardin. He had also an enthusiasm
for Delacroix: less for his exaggerated colouring than for the lofty mark of
style in the gestures and movements painted by this great Romanticist, which
Degas endeavoured to transfer to the pantomime of the ballet. From Manet
he learnt softness and fluency of modelling. And finally the Japanese communicated
to him the principle of their dispersed composition, the choice
of standpoint, allowing the artist to look up from beneath or down from
above, the taste for fantastic decoration, the suggestive method of emphasising
this and suppressing that, the surprise of detail introduced here and
there in a perfectly arbitrary fashion. From the original and bizarre
union of all these elements he formed his exquisite, marvellously expressive,
and entirely personal style, which is hard to describe with the pen, and
would be defectively indicated by reference to Besnard, who is allied to him
in the treatment of light.
It is only in literature that
Degas has a parallel. If a
comparison between them be
at all possible, it might be
said that his style in many
ways recalls that of the
brothers de Goncourt. As
these have enriched their
language with a new vocabulary
for the expression of new
emotions, Degas has made
for himself a new technique.
Utterly despising everything
pretty and anecdotic, he has
the secret of gaining the
effect intended by refinements
of drawing and tone-values,
just as the de Goncourts
by the association of
words; he has borrowed
phrases from all the lexicons
of painting; he has mixed
oils, pastel, and water-colour
together, and, such as he
is to-day, he must, like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span>
de Goncourts, be reckoned amongst the most delicate and refined artists of the
century.</p>

<p>His range of subjects finds its limit in one point: he has the greatest contempt
for banality, for the repetition of others and of himself. Every subject
has to give opportunity for the introduction of special models, not hitherto
employed, of pictorial experiments and novel problems of light. He made
his starting-point, the grace and charming movements of women. Trim
Parisian laundresses in their spotless aprons, little shop-girls in their <i>boutiques</i>,
the spare grace of racehorses with their elastic jockeys, marvellous portraits,
like that of Duranty, women getting out of the bath, the movements of the
workwoman, and the toilette and <i>négligé</i> of the woman of the world, boudoir
scenes, scenes in court, and scenes in boxes at the theatre&mdash;he has painted
them all. And with what truth and life! How admirably his figures stand!
how completely they are what they give themselves out to be! The Circus and
the Opera soon became his favourite field of study. In his ballet-girls he found
fresher artistic material than in the goddesses and nymphs of the antique.</p>

<p>At the same time the highest conceivable demands were here made on the
capacities of the painter and the draughtsman, and on his powers of characterisation.
Of all modern artists Degas is the man who creates the greatest
illusion as an interpreter of artificial light, of the glare of the footlights before
which these <i>décolleté</i> singers move in their gauze skirts. And these dancers
are real dancers, vivid every one of them, every one of them individual. The
nervous force of the born ballerina is sharply differentiated from the apathy
of the others who merely earn their bread by their legs. How fine are his
novices with tired, faded, pretty faces, when they have to sweep a curtsey,
and pose so awkwardly in their delightful shyness. How marvellously he
has grasped the fleeting charm of this moment. With what spirited nonchalance
he groups his girls enveloped in white muslin and coloured sashes.
Like the Japanese, he claims the right of rendering only what interests him
and appears to make a striking effect&mdash;&ldquo;the vivid points,&rdquo; in Hokusai&rsquo;s
phrase&mdash;and does not hold himself bound to add a lifeless piece of canvas for
the sake of &ldquo;rounded composition.&rdquo; In pictures, where it is his purpose to
show the varied forms of the legs and feet of his dancers, he only paints the
upper part of the orchestra and the lower part of the stage&mdash;that is to say,
heads, hands, and instruments below, and dancing legs above. He is equally
uncompromising in his street and racing scenes, so that often it is merely the
hindquarters of the horses and the back of the jockey that are visible. His
pictures, however, owe not a little of their life and piquancy to this brilliant
method of cutting through the middle, and to these triumphant evasions of
all the vulgar rules of composition. But, for the matter of that, surely Dürer
knew what he was about when, in his pictures of apocalyptic riders, instead
of completing the composition, he left it fragmentary, to create an impression
of the wild gallop.</p>

<p>A special group amongst the artist&rsquo;s ballet pictures is that in which he
represents the training of novices, the severe course through which the grub
must pass before taking wing as a butterfly. Here is displayed a strange
fantastic anatomy, only comparable to the acrobatic distortions to which the
Japanese are so much addicted in their art. But it is precisely these pictures
which were of determining importance for the development of Degas. In the
quest of unstable lines and expressions, instead of feeling reality in all its
charming grace, he came to behold it only in its degeneration. He was impelled
to render the large outline of the modern woman&mdash;the female figure
which has grown to be a product of art beneath the array of toilette&mdash;even
in the most ungraceful moments. He painted the woman who does not suspect
that she is being observed; he painted her seen, as it were, through the key-hole
or the slit of a curtain, and making, to some extent, the most atrociously
ugly movements. He was the merciless observer of creatures whom society
turns into machines for its pleasure&mdash;dancing, racing, and erotic machines.
He has depicted cruelly the sort of woman Zola has drawn in Nana&mdash;the
woman who has no expression, no play in her eyes, the woman who is merely
animal, motionless as a Hindu idol. His pictures of this class are a natural
history of prostitution of terrible veracity, a great poem on the flesh, like the
works of Titian and Rubens, except that in the latter blooming beauty is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span>
substance of the brilliant strophes, while in Degas it is wrinkled skin, decaying
youth, and the artificial brightness of enamelled faces. &ldquo;<i>A vous autres il

<p>This sense of having lived too much expressed itself also in the haughty
contempt with which he withdrew himself from exhibitions, the public, and
criticism. Any one who is not a constant visitor at Durand-Ruel&rsquo;s has little
opportunity of seeing the pictures of Degas. The conception of fame is
something which he does not seem to possess. Being a man of cool self-reliance,
he paints to please himself, without caring how his pictures may
suit the notions of the world or the usages of the schools. For years he has
kept aloof from the Salon, and some people say that he has never exhibited
at all. And he keeps at as great a distance from Parisian society. In earlier
days, when Manet, Pissarro, and Duranty met at the Café Nouvelle Athènes,
he sometimes appeared after ten o&rsquo;clock&mdash;a little man with round shoulders
and a shuffling walk, who only took part in the conversation by now and then
breaking in with brief, sarcastic observations. After Manet&rsquo;s death he made
the Café de la Rochefoucauld his place of resort. And young painters went
on his account also to the Café de la Rochefoucauld and pointed him out to
each other, saying, &ldquo;That is Degas.&rdquo; When artists assemble together the
conversation usually turns upon him, and he is accorded the highest honours
by the younger generation. He is revered as the haughty <i>Independant</i> who
stands unapproachably above the <i>profanum vulgus</i>, the great unknown who
never passed through the ordeal of a hanging committee, but whose spirit
hovers invisibly over every exhibition.</p>

<p>A refined <i>charmeur</i>, <i>Auguste Renoir</i>, has made important discoveries, in
portrait painting especially. He is peculiarly the painter of women, whose
elegance, delicate skin, and velvet flesh he interprets with extraordinary
deftness. Léon Bonnat&rsquo;s portraits were great pieces of still-life. The persons
sit as if they were nailed to their seats. Their flesh looks like zinc and their
clothes like steel. In Carolus Duran&rsquo;s hands portrait painting degenerated
into a painting of draperies. Most of his portraits merely betray the amount
which the toilettes have cost; they are inspired by their rich array of silk
and heavy curtains; often they are crude symphonies in velvet and satin.
The rustle of robes, the dazzling&mdash;or loud&mdash;fulness of colour in glistening
materials, gave him greater pleasure than the lustre of flesh-tints and any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span>
glance of inquiry into the moral temperament of his models. Renoir endeavours
to arrest the scarcely perceptible and transitory movements of the
features and the figure. Placing his persons boldly in the real light of day
which streams around, he paints atmospheric influences in all their results, like
a landscapist. Light is the sole and absolute thing. The fallen trunk of a tree
upon which the broken sunlight plays in yellow and light green reflections,
and the body or head of a girl, are subject to the same laws. Stippled with
yellowish-green spots of light, the latter loses its contours and becomes a part
of nature. With this study of the effects of light and reflection there is united
an astonishing sureness in the analysis of sudden phases of expression. The
way in which laughter begins and ends, the moment between laughter and
weeping, the passing flash of an eye, a fleeting motion of the lips, all that
comes like lightning and vanishes as swiftly, shades of expression which had
hitherto seemed indefinable, are seized by Renoir in all their suddenness. In
the portraits of Bonnat and Duran there are people who have &ldquo;sat,&rdquo; but here
are people from whom the painter has had the power of stealing and holding
fast the secret of their being at a moment when they were not &ldquo;sitting.&rdquo;
Here are dreamy blond girls gazing out of their great blue eyes, ethereal
fragrant flowers, like lilies leaning against a rose-bush through which the rays
of the setting sun are shining. Here are coquettish young girls, now laughing,
now pouting, now blithe and gay, now angry once more, and now betwixt
both moods in a charming passion. And there are women of the world of
consummate elegance, slender and slight-built figures, with small hands and
feet, an even pallor, almond-shaped eyes catching every light, moist shining
lips of a tender grace, bearing witness to a love of pleasure refined by artifice.
And children especially there are, children of the sensitive and flexuous type:
some as yet unconscious, dreamy, and free from thought; others already
animated, correct in pose, graceful, and wise. The three girls, in his &ldquo;Portrait
of Mesdemoiselles M&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; grouped around the piano, the eldest playing, the
second accompanying upon the violin, and the youngest quietly attentive,
with both hands resting upon the piano, are exquisite, painted with an entirely
naïve and novel truth. All the poses are natural, all the colours bright and
subtle&mdash;the furniture, the yellow bunches of flowers, the fresh spring dresses,
the silk stockings. But such tender poems of childhood and blossoming
girlhood form merely a part of Renoir&rsquo;s work. In his &ldquo;Dinner at Chaton&rdquo;
a company of ladies and gentlemen are seated at table, laughing, talking,
and listening; the champagne sparkles in the glasses, and the cheerful, easy
mood which comes with dessert is in the ascendant. In his &ldquo;Moulin de la
Galette&rdquo; he painted the excitement of the dance&mdash;whirling pairs, animated
faces, languid poses, and everything enveloped in sunlight and dust. Renoir&rsquo;s
peculiar field is the study of the various delicate emotions which colour the
human countenance.</p>

<p>The merit of <i>Camille Pissarro</i> is to have once more set the painting of
peasants, weakened by Breton, upon the virile lines of Millet, and to have
supplemented them in those places where Millet was technically inadequate.
When the Impressionist movement began Camille Pissarro had already a
past: he was the recognised landscape painter of the Norman plains; the
straightforward observer of peasants, the plain and simple painter of the
vegetable gardens stretching round peasant dwellings. Since Millet, no artist
had placed himself in closer relationship to the life of the earth and of cultivated
nature. Though a delicate analyst, Pissarro had not the epic feeling nor the
religious mysticism of Millet; but like Millet he was a rustic in spirit, like him
a Norman, from the land of vineyards, of large farmyards, green meadows,
soft avenues of poplars, and wide horizons reddened by the sun. He was
healthy, tender, and intimate in
feeling, rejoiced in the richness
of the land and the voluptuous
undulation of fields, and he could
give a striking impression of a
region in its work-a-day character.
Celebrated in the press
as the legitimate descendant of
Millet, he might have contented
himself with his regular successes.
He had, indeed, arrived at an
age when men usually leave off
making experiments, and reap
what they have sown in their
youth, at an age when many
conquerors occupy themselves
with the mechanical reproduction
of their own works. Nevertheless
the Impressionistic movement
became for Pissarro the
starting-point of a new way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span></p>

<p>He aimed at fresher, intenser,
and more transparent light, at
a more cogent observation of
phenomena, at a more exact
analysis of the encompassing
atmosphere. He celebrated the
eternal, immutable light in which
the world is bathed. He loved
it specially during clear afternoons,
when it plays over bright
green meadows fringed by soft
trees, or at the foot of low hills.
He has sought it on the slopes
across which it ripples deliciously, on the plains from which it rises
like a light veil of gauze. He studied the play of light upon the bronzed
skin of labourers, on the coats of animals, on the foliage and fruit of
trees. He characterised the seasons, the hour of day, the moment, with the
conscientiousness of a peasant intent upon noting the direction of the
wind and the position of the sun. The cold, chilly humour of autumn
afternoons, the vivid clarity of sparkling wintry skies, the bloom and lightness
of spring mornings, the oppressive brooding of summer, the luxuriance or the
aridity of the earth, the young vigour of foliage or the fading of nature robbed
of her adornment,&mdash;all these Pissarro has painted with largeness, plainness,
and simplicity. He strays over the fields, watching the shepherd driving
out his flock, the wains rumbling along the uneven roads, the quiet, rhythmical
movement of the gleaners, the graceful gait of the women who have been
reaping and now return home in the evening with a rake across their shoulders;
he stations himself at the entrance of villages where the apple-pickers are at
work, and the women minding geese stand by their drove; he notes the whole
life of peasants, and gives truer and more direct intelligence of it than Millet
did in his broad, synthetic manner. Where there is a classic quietude and an
oily heaviness in Millet, there is in Pissarro palpitating life, transparence,
and freshness. He sees the country in bright, laughing tones; and the pure
white of the kerchiefs, the pale rose-colour or tender blue bodices of his peasant
women, lend his pictures a blithe delicacy of colour. His girls are like fresh
flowers of the field which the sun of June brings forth upon the meadows.
There is something intense and yet soft, strong and delicate, true and rhythmical
in Pissarro&rsquo;s tender poems of country life.</p>

<p>So long as any advance beyond Rousseau and Corot seemed impossible,
pictures of talent but only moderate importance had increased in number
in the province of landscape. The landscape painters who immediately
followed the great pioneers loved nature on account of her comparative coolness
in summer; upon sites where the classic artists of Fontainebleau dreamed and
painted they built comfortable villas and settled down with the sentiments
of a householder. The country was parcelled out, and each one undertook
his part, and painted it conscientiously without arousing any novel sensations.
Impressionism gave landscape painting, which showed signs of being split
into specialties, once more a firm basis, a charming field of study. To communicate
impressions without any of the studio combinations, just as they
strike us suddenly, to preserve the vividness and cogency of the first imprint
of nature upon the mind, was the great problem which Impressionism placed
before the landscape painters. The artists of Fontainebleau painted neither
the rawness and rigidity of
winter nor the sultry atmosphere
and scorching heat
of summer; they painted
artistic and dignified and
exquisite works. The Impressionists
did not approach
their themes as poets, but as
naturalists. In their hands
landscape, which in Corot,
Millet, Diaz, Rousseau,
Daubigny, and Jongkind is
an occasional poem, becomes
a likeness of a region
under special influences of
light. With more delicate
nerves, and a sensibility
almost greater, they allowed
nature to work upon them,
and perceived in the symphonies
of every hour
strains never heard before,
transparent shadows, the
vibration of atoms of light.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
decomposing the lines of contour, that tremor of the atmosphere which is
the breath of landscape. Here also England was not without influence. As
Corot and Rousseau received an impulse from Constable and Bonington in
1830, Monet and Sisley returned from London with their eyes dazzled by the
light of the great Turner. Laid hold upon, like Turner, by the miracles of
the universe, by the golden haze which trembles in a sunbeam, they succeeded
in painting light in spite of the defectiveness of our chemical mediums.</p>

<p><i>Alfred Sisley</i> might be compared with Daubigny. He settled in the
neighbourhood of Moret, upon the banks of the Loing, and is the most soft
and tender amongst the Impressionists. Like Daubigny, he loves the germinating
energy, the blossoming, and the growth of young and luminous
spring; the moist banks of quiet streamlets, budding beeches, and the rye-fields
growing green, the variegated flowering of the meadows, clear skies, ladies
walking in bright spring dresses, and the play of light upon the vernal foliage.
He has painted tender mornings breathed upon with rosy bloom, reeds with
a bluish gleam, and moist duck-weed, grey clouds mirrored in lonely pools,
alleys of poplar, peasants&rsquo; houses, and hills and banks, melting softly in the
warm atmosphere. His pictures, like those of the master of Oise, leave the
impression of youth and freshness, of quiet happiness, or of smiling melancholy.</p>

<p>On many of his pictures, saturated as they are with light, <i>Claude Monet</i> could
inscribe the name of Turner without inciting unbelief. In exceedingly unequal
works, which are nevertheless full of audacity and genius, he has grasped
what would seem to be intangible. Except Turner there is no one who has
carried so far the study of the effects of light, of the gradations and reflections
of sunbeams, of momentary phases of illumination, no one who has embodied
more subtle and forcible impressions. For Monet man has no existence,
but only the earth and the light. He delights in the rugged rocks of Belle-Isle,
and the wild banks of the Creuse, when the oppressive sun of summer
is brooding over them. He paints phenomena as transitory as the shades
of expression in Renoir. The world appears in a glory of light, such as it
only has in fleeting moments, and such as would be blinding were it always
to be seen. Nature, in his version, is an inhospitable dwelling where it is impossible
to dream and live. One hopes sometimes to hear a word of intimate
association from Monet&mdash;but in vain; Claude Monet is only an eye. Carouses
of sunshine and orgies in the open air are the exclusive materials of his pictures.
Thus he has little to say for those who seek the soul of a human being in
every landscape. Like Degas, he is <i>par excellence</i> the master in technique
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>
whose highest endeavour is to enrich the art of painting with novel sensations
and unedited effects, even if it has to be done by violence. There are sea-pieces
filled with the spirit of evening, when the sea, red as a mirror of copper,
merges into the glory of the sky, in a great radiant ocean of infinity; moods
of evening storm, when gloomy clouds over the restless tree-tops race across
the smoky red sky, losing tiny shreds in their flight, little thin strips of loosened
cloud, saturated through and through with a wine-red glow by the splendour
of the sun. Or there are spring meadows fragrant with bloom, and hills
parched by the sun; rushing trains with their white smoke gleaming in the
light; yellow sails scudding over glittering waters; waves shining blue, red,
and golden; and burning ships, with shooting tongues of flame leaping upon
the masts; and, behind, a jagged rim of the evening glow. Claude Monet has
followed light everywhere&mdash;in Holland, Normandy, the South of France,
Belle-Isle-en-Mer, the villages of the Seine, London, Algiers, Brittany. He
became an enthusiast for nature as she is in Norway and Sweden, for French
cathedrals rising into the sky, tall and fair, like the peaks of great promontories.
He interpreted the surge of towns, the movement of the sea, the majestic
solitude of the sky. But he knows too that the artist could pass his life in the
same corner of the earth and work for years upon the same objects without
the drama of nature played before him ever becoming exhausted. For the
light which streams between things is for ever different. So he stood one
evening two paces in front of his little house, in the garden, amid a flaming
sea of flowers scarlet like poppies. White summer clouds shifted in the sky,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span>
and the beams of the setting sun fell upon two stacks, standing solitary in
a solitary field. Claude Monet began to paint, and came again the next
day, and the day after that, and every day throughout the autumn, and
winter, and spring. In a series of fifteen pictures, &ldquo;The Hay-ricks,&rdquo; he painted&mdash;as
Hokusai did in his hundred views of the Fuji mountain&mdash;the endless
variations produced by season, day, and hour upon the eternal countenance
of nature. The lonely field is like a glass, catching the effects of atmosphere,
the breeze, and the most fleeting light. The stacks gleam softly in the brightness
of the beautiful afternoons, stand out sharp and clear against the cold
sky of the forenoon, loom like phantoms in the mist of a November evening,
or sparkle like glittering jewels beneath the caress of the rising sun. They
shine like glowing ovens, absorbed by the light of the autumnal sunset;
they are surrounded as by a rosy halo, when the early sun pierces like a wedge
through the dense morning mist. They rise distinctly, covered with sparkling,
rose-tinged snow, into the cloudless heaven, and cast their pure, blue shadows
upon the silent, white, wintry landscape, or stand out in ghostly outlines
against the night firmament, mantled with silver by the moonlight. Without
moving his easel, Monet has interpreted the silence of winter, and autumn
with her sad and splendid feasts of colour&mdash;dusk and rain, snow and frost
and sun. He heard the voices of evening and the jubilation of morning; he
painted the eternal undulation of light upon the same objects, the altered
impression which the same particle of nature yields according to the changing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>
light of the hour. He chanted the poetry of the universe in a single fragment
of nature, and would be a pantheistic artist of world-wide compass had he
merely painted these stacks of hay for the rest of his natural existence.</p>

<p>And here ends the battle for the liberation of modern art. <i>Libertas artibus
restituta.</i> The painters of the nineteenth century are no longer imitators,
but have become makers of a new thing, &ldquo;enlargers of the empire.&rdquo; The
prophetic words written in the beginning of the nineteenth century by the
Hamburger, Philipp Otto Runge, &ldquo;light, colour, and moving life,&rdquo; were to
form the great problem, the great conquest of modern art; they were fulfilled
after two generations. Through the Impressionists art was enriched by an
opulence of new beauties. A new and independent style had been discovered
for the representation of new things, and a new province&mdash;a province peculiar
to herself&mdash;was won for painting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>151</span></p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XXXII</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE NEW IDEALISM IN ENGLAND</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">The</span> flood of Impressionism was at the same time crossed by another
current. Impressionism was a phase of progressive art of world-wide
influence. It proclaimed that nature and life were the inexhaustible mine
of beauty. Then after Naturalism had taught artists to work upon the
impressions of external reality in an independent manner, a transition was
made by some who embodied the impressions of their inward spirit in a free
creative fashion, unborrowed from the old masters.</p>

<p>We feel the need of living not merely in the world around us, but in an
inner world that we build up ourselves, a world far more strange and fair,
far more luminous than that in which our feet stumble so helplessly. We
must needs mount upon the pinions of fancy into the wide land of vision,
build castles in the clouds, watch their rise and their fall, and follow into misty
distance the freaks of their changing architecture. The more grey and colourless
the present may be, the more alluringly does the fairy splendour of
vanished worlds of beauty flit before us. It is the very banality of everyday
life that renders us more sensitive to the delicate charm of old myths, and
we receive them in a more childlike, impressionable way than any earlier
age, for we look upon them with fresh eyes that have been rendered keen by
yearning.</p>

<p>From all this it is evident that Impressionism could not remain the mode
of expression for the whole world of the present day. The longing for old-world
romance would brook no refusal. It was demanded from art not that
she should mirror nature, nature could be seen without her aid, but that she
should carry us away on dream-wings to a distant world more beautiful than
our own; not that she should be merely modern, but that she should afford
us even to-day some reflection of that beauty which sheds forth its lustre
from the works of the old masters.</p>

<p>This yearning after far-off worlds of beauty was combined with a demand
for new delights of colour. The Impressionists had centred every effort
in compassing the most difficult elements of the world of phenomena&mdash;light,
air, and colour&mdash;ending in extreme imitation of reality. Then came a desire
for colours, more radiant, more vivid than ever was seen on this poor
world of ours; and since hardly any of the younger generation fulfilled the
desire of the modern longing, the standard of a bygone age was raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>
aloft, and there set in the anti-naturalistic, anti-modern current that still
survived from the age of romance in the work-a-day world of the present.</p>

<p>How was it possible that England should have taken the lead upon this
occasion also? Can an Englishman, a matter-of-fact being who finds
his happiness in comfort and a practical sphere of action, be at the same time
a Romanticist? Is not London the most modern town in Europe? Yet,
without a question, this is the very reason why the New Romanticism found
its earliest expression there, although it was the place where Naturalism
had reigned longest and with the greatest strictness. There was a reaction
against the prose of everyday life, just as, in the earlier part of the century,
English landscape painting had been a reaction against town life. To escape
the whistle of locomotives and the restless bustle of the struggle for existence,
men take refuge in a far-off world, a world where everything is fair and graceful,
and all emotions tender and noble, a world where no rudeness, no discord,
and nothing fierce or brutal disturbs the harmony of ideal perfection. These
artists become revellers in a land of fantasy, and flee from reality to an inner
life which they have created for themselves, wander from London&rsquo;s railways
and fogs to the sunny Italy of Botticelli, take their rest in the land of poetry,
and come back with packing-cases full of lovely pictures and hearts full of
happy emotions.</p>

<p>Moreover, they find in the primitive artists that simplicity which is most
refreshing of all to overstrained spirits. Having produced Byron, Shelley,
and Turner, the English were artistic <i>gourmets</i>, sated with all enjoyments
in the realms of the intellect, and they now meditated works through which
yet a new thrill of beauty might pass through the imagination. In the
primitive masters they discovered all the qualities which had vanished from
art since the sixteenth century&mdash;inofficious purity, innocent and touching
Naturalism, antiquated austerity, and an enchanting depth of feeling. Jaded
with other experiences, they admired in those naïve spirits the capacity for
ecstatic rapture and vision&mdash;in other words, for the highest gratification.
If one could but have in this nineteenth century such feelings as were known
to Dante, the gloomy Florentine; Botticelli, the great Jeremiah of the Renaissance;
or the tender mystic Fra Angelico! Surfeited with modernity,
and endowed with nerves of acute refinement, artists went back in their
fancy to this luxuriously blissful condition, and finally came to the point at
which modernity was transformed once more into childish babble and the
unbelieving materialism of the present age into a mystical and romantic
union with the old currents of emotion.</p>

<p>Under the influence of Dante Gabriel Rossetti English pre-Raphaelitism
now entered upon a new and entirely different phase.</p>

<p>Although Rossetti was the soul of the earlier movement, he was a man
whose temperament was even then essentially different from that of his
comrades Millais and Hunt, who founded the Brotherhood with him in 1848.
Even the two works which he exhibited with them in 1849 and 1850 make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>153</span>
one feel the great gulf which lay between him and them. In the former
year, when Hunt was represented by his &ldquo;Rienzi,&rdquo; and Millais by his
&ldquo;Lorenzo and Isabella,&rdquo; Rossetti produced his &ldquo;Girlhood of Mary Virgin.&rdquo;
In the following, when Hunt painted &ldquo;The Converted British Family sheltering
a Christian Missionary&rdquo; and Millais &ldquo;The Child Jesus in the Workshop
of Joseph the Carpenter,&rdquo; Rossetti came forward with his &ldquo;Ecce Ancilla
Domini.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Girlhood of Mary Virgin&rdquo; was a little picture of austere
simplicity and ascetic character; it was intentionally angular in drawing,
and possessed a certain archaic bloom. The Virgin, clad in grey garments,
sits at a curiously shaped frame embroidering a lily with gold threads upon a
red ground. The flower she is copying stands before her in a vase, and a little
angel, with roseate wings, is watering it with an air of abashed reverence.
St. Anne is busy by the side of the Virgin&mdash;both being, respectively, portraits
of the artist&rsquo;s mother and sister&mdash;and in the background St. Joachim is binding
a vine to a trellis. And several Latin books are lying upon the floor.
The second work, &ldquo;Ecce Ancilla Domini,&rdquo; is the familiar picture which is
now in the National Gallery&mdash;a harmony of white upon white of indescribable
graciousness and delicacy. Mary, a bashful, meditative, and childlike maiden,
in a white garment, is shown in a half-kneeling attitude upon a white bed.
The walls of the chamber are white, and in front of her there stands a frame
at which she has been working; and a piece of embroidery, with a lily which
she has begun, hangs over it. Before her stands the angel with flame rising
from his feet, in solemn, peaceful gravity, as he extends towards her the
stalk of the lily which he holds. A
dove flies gently in through the
window. Now, in spite of their
romantic subjects the work of Hunt
and Millais is lucid and temperate,
while Rossetti is dreamily mystical.
The two former were straightforward,
true, and natural, whereas the simplicity
of the latter was subtilised
and consciously affected. It was due
to the vibrating delicacy of his distempered,
seething imagination that
he was able to give himself a deceptive
appearance of being a primitive
artist. The creative power of the
two former is an earnest power of
the understanding, whereas in the
latter there is a vague dreaminess,
a tendency to luxuriate in his own
moods, an efflorescence of tones and
colours. In the one case there is an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
angular but single-minded study of nature; in the other there is the demureness
and embarrassment of the Quattrocento, a demureness breaking into blossom,
and an embarrassment full of charm&mdash;a romanticism which cherished the
yearning for repose in the childlike and innocent Middle Ages, and clothed it
with all the attractions of mysticism. Holman Hunt, Madox Brown, and
Millais were realists in their drawing, men who wanted to represent objects
with all possible accuracy, to be faithful in rendering the finest fibre of a
petal and every thread in a fabric. Rossetti&rsquo;s picture was a symphonic ode
in pigments, and he himself was one of the earliest of the modern lyricists of
colour. This distinction became wider and wider with the course of time,
and as early as 1858 he found himself deserted by his earlier comrades. Madox
Brown, Holman Hunt, and especially Millais, in their further development,
tended more and more to become Naturalists, and were finally led to completely
realistic subjects from the immediate present by the inviolable fidelity
with which they studied nature. On the other hand, Rossetti became the
centre of a new circle of artists, who directed the current of what was originally
Naturalism more and more into mysticism and refined archaism.</p>

<p>In 1856 <i>The Oxford and
Cambridge Magazine</i> was
founded as a monthly periodical.
There were several
contributions by Rossetti,
and in this way he became
so well known in Oxford
that the Union accepted an
offer from him to execute
a series of wall-paintings.
Accordingly he painted
several pictures from the
Arthurian legends, making
the sketches for them himself,
and employing for
their elaboration a number
of young men, some of
them amateur artists and
students at the University.
In this way he came into
connection with Arthur
Hughes, William Morris,
and Edward Burne-Jones.
These artists, afterwards
joined by Spencer Stanhope
and Walter Crane, both of
them younger men, became&mdash;with
George Frederick Watts at their flank&mdash;the leading members of the
new brotherhood, the representatives of that New pre-Raphaelitism in which
interest is still centred in England.</p>

<p>Their art is a kind of Italian Renaissance upon English soil. The romantic
chord which vibrates in old English poetry is united to the grace and purity
of Italian taste, the classical lucidity of the Pagan mythology with Catholic
mysticism, and the most modern riot of emotion with the demure vesture of
the primitive Florentines. Through this mixture of heterogeneous elements
English New Idealism is probably the most remarkable form of art upon
which the sun has ever shone: borrowed and yet in the highest degree personal,
it is an art combining an almost childlike simplicity of feeling with a morbid
<i>hautgoût</i>, the most attentive and intelligent study of the old masters with free,
creative, modern imagination, the most graceful sureness of drawing and the
most sparkling individuality of colour with a helpless, stammering accent
introduced of set purpose. The old Quattrocentisti wander amongst the
real Italian flowers; but with the New pre-Raphaelites one enters a hot-house:
one is met by a soft damp heat, bright exotic flowers exhale an overpowering
fragrance, juicy fruits catch the eye, and slender palms, through
the branches of which no rough wind may bluster, gently sway their long,
broad fans.</p>

<p>Professor Lombroso would certainly find the material for ingenious disquisition
in Rossetti, who introduced this
Italian phase, and himself came of an Italian
stock. And it might almost seem as if a soul
from those old times had found its reincarnation
in the lonely painter who lived at Chelsea,
though it was a soul who no longer bore
heaven in his heart like Fra Angelico. In his
whole being he seems like a phenomenon of
atavism, like a citizen of that long-buried Italy
who, after many transmigrations, had strayed
into the misty North, to the bank of the Thames,
and from thence looked in his home-sickness
ever towards the South, enveloped in poetry
and glowing in the sun.</p>

<p>Dante Gabriel Rossetti was a Catholic and
an Italian. Amid his English surroundings he
kept the feelings of one of Latin race. His
father, the patriot and commentator upon
Dante, had originally lived in Naples, and inflamed
the popular party there by his passionate
writings. In consequence of the active
part which he took in political agitation he
lost his post at the Bourbon Museum, escaped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>
from Italy upon a warship,
disguised as an English officer,
settled in London in 1824,
and married Francesca Polidori,
the daughter of a secretary
of Count Alfieri. Here
he became Professor of the
Italian language at King&rsquo;s
College, and published several
works on Dante, the most
important of which, <i>Dante&rsquo;s
Beatrice</i>, written in 1852,
once more supported the
theory that Beatrice was not
a real person. Dante Gabriel,
the son of this Dante student
Gabriele Rossetti, was born in
London on 12th May 1828.
The whole family actively
contributed to scholarship
and poetry. His elder sister,
Maria Francesca, was the
authoress of <i>A Shadow of
Dante</i>, a work which gives a
most valuable explanation of
the scheme of <i>The Divine
Comedy</i>; his younger sister, Christina, was one of the most eminent poetesses
of England; and his brother, William Michael Rossetti, is well known as an
art-critic and a student of Shelley. Even from early youth Dante Gabriel
Rossetti was familiar with the world of Dante, and brought up in the
worship of Dante&rsquo;s wonderful age and an enthusiasm for his mystic and
transcendental poetry. He knew Dante by heart, and Guido Cavalcanti.
The mystical poet became his guide through life, and led him to Fra
Angelico, the mystic of painting. Indeed, the world of Dante and of the
painters antecedent to Raphael is his spiritual home.</p>

<p>He was barely eighteen when he became a pupil at the Royal Academy,
studying a couple of years later under Madox Brown, who was not many
years older than himself. Even then Rossetti had an almost mesmeric influence
upon his friends. He was a pale, tall, thin young man, who always
walked with a slight stoop; reserved, dry in his manner, and careless in dress,
there was nothing captivating about him at a transitory meeting. But his
pale face was lit up by his unusually reflective, deeply clouded, contemplative
eyes; and about his defiant mouth there played that contempt of the
profane crowd which is natural to a superior mind, while the laurel of fame
was already twined about his
youthful forehead. In 1849,
when he was exhibiting his
earliest picture, he had published
in <i>The Germ</i>, to say nothing of
his numerous poems, a mystical,
visionary, sketch in prose named
<i>Hand and Soul</i>, which was much
praised by men of the highest
intellect in London. Soon afterwards
he published a volume
entitled <i>Dante and his Circle</i>, in
which he translated a number
of old Italian poems, and rendered
Dante&rsquo;s <i>Vita Nuova</i> into
strictly archaic English prose.
Reserved as he was towards
strangers, he was irresistibly
attractive to his friends, and his
brilliant, genial conversation won
him the goodwill of every one.
A man of gifted and delicate
nature, sensitive to an extreme degree, a sedentary student who had yet an
enthusiasm for knightly deeds, a jaded spirit capable of morbidly heightened,
exotic sensibility and soft, melting reverie, one whose overstrained nerves
only vibrated if he slept in the daytime and worked at night, it seemed as
though Rossetti was born to be the father of the <i>décadence</i>, of that state of
spirit which every one now perceives to be flooding Europe.</p>

<p>His later career was as quiet as its opening had been brilliant. After
that graciously sentimental little picture, &ldquo;Ecce Ancilla Domini,&rdquo; Rossetti
exhibited in public only once again; this was in 1856. From that date the
public saw no more of his painting. He worked only for his friends and the
friends of his friends. He was famous only in private, and looked up to
like a god within a narrow circle of admirers. One of his acquaintances,
the painter Deverell, had introduced him in 1850 to the woman who became
for him what Saskia Uylenburgh had been for Rembrandt and Helene Fourment
for Rubens&mdash;his type of feminine beauty. She was a young dressmaker&rsquo;s
assistant, Miss Eleanor Siddal. Her thick, heavy hair was fair,
with that faint reddish tint in it which Titian painted; it grew in two tapering
bands deep down into the neck, being there somewhat fairer than it was
above, and it curled thickly. Her eyes had something indefinite in their
expression; nothing, however, that was dreamy, mobile, and changeable,
for they seemed rather to be insuperable, fathomless, and unnaturally vivid.
All the play of her countenance lay in the lower part of her face, in the nostrils,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
mouth, and chin. The mouth, indeed, with its deep corners, sharply chiselled
outlines, and lips triumphantly curved, was particularly expressive. And her
tall, slender figure had a refined distinction of line. In 1860 they married.
Some of his most beautiful works were painted during this epoch&mdash;the &ldquo;Beata
Beatrix,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Sibylla Palmifera,&rdquo; &ldquo;Monna Vanna,&rdquo; &ldquo;Venus Verticordia,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lady Lilith,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Beloved&rdquo;&mdash;pictures which he painted without
a thought of exhibition or success. After a union of barely two years this
passionately loved woman died, shortly after the birth of a still-born child.
He laid a whole volume of manuscript poems&mdash;many of them inspired by
her&mdash;in the coffin, and they were buried with her. From that time he lived
solitary and secluded from the world, surrounded by mediæval antiques,
in his old-fashioned house at Chelsea, entirely given up to his dreams, a
stranger in a world without light. He suffered much from ill-health, and
was sensitive and hypochondriacal, and, indeed, undermined his health by
an immoderate use of chloral. His friends entreated him to bring out his
poems, and all England was expectant when Rossetti at length yielded to
pressure, opened the grave of his wife, and took out the manuscript. The
poems appeared in the April of 1870. The first edition was bought up in
ten days, and there followed six others. Wherever he appeared he was
honoured like a god. But the attacks directed against the first pictures of
the pre-Raphaelites were repeated, although now transferred to another region.
A pseudonymous article by Robert Buchanan in the <i>Contemporary Review</i>, and
published afterwards as a pamphlet, entitled <i>The Fleshly School of Poetry</i>,
accused Rossetti of immorality and imitation of Baudelaire and the Marquis
de Sade. Rossetti stepped once more into the arena, and replied by a letter
in the <i>Athenæum</i> headed <i>The Stealthy School of Criticism</i>. From that time
he shut himself up completely, never went out, and led &ldquo;the hole-and-cornerest
existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1881 he published a second volume of poems, chiefly composed of
ballads and sonnets. A year afterwards, on 10th April 1882, he died,
honoured, even in the academical circles in which he never mingled, as one
of the greatest men in England. The exhibition of his works which was
opened a couple of months after his death created an immense sensation.
Those of his pictures which had not been already sold straight from the easel
were paid for with their weight in gold, and are now scattered in great English
country mansions and certain private galleries in Florence. The only very
rich collection in London is that of an intimate friend of the artist, the late
Mr. Leyland, who had gathered together, in his splendid house in the West
End, probably the most beautiful work of which the East can boast in carpets
and vases, or the early Renaissance in intaglios, small bronzes, and ornaments.
Here, surrounded by the quaint and delicate pictures of Carlo Crivelli
and Botticelli, Rossetti was in the society of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>His range of subject was not wide. In his earliest period he had a fancy
for painting small biblical pictures, of which &ldquo;Ecce Ancilla Domini&rdquo; is the
best known, and the delightfully archaic &ldquo;Girlhood of Mary Virgin&rdquo; one of
the most beautiful. But this austerely biblical tendency was not of long
continuance. It soon gave way to a brilliant, imaginative Romanticism,
to which he was prompted by Dante. &ldquo;Giotto painting the Portrait of
Dante,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Salutation of Beatrice on Earth and in Eden&rdquo; (from the
<i>Vita Nuova</i>), &ldquo;La Pia&rdquo; (from the <i>Purgatorio</i>), the &ldquo;Beata Beatrix,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Dante&rsquo;s Dream,&rdquo; in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, are the leading
works which arose under the influence of the great Italian. The head of
his wife, with her heavily veiled eyes, and Giotto&rsquo;s well-known picture of
Dante, sufficed him for the creation of the most tender, mystical poems,
which, at the same time, show him in all the splendour of his wealth of colour.
He revels in the most brilliant hues; his pictures have the appearance of being
bathed in a glow; and there is something deeply sensuous in his vivid and
lustrous green, red, and violet tones. In the picture &ldquo;Dante on the Anniversary
of Beatrice&rsquo;s Death&rdquo; the poet kneels at the open window which
looks out upon Florence; he has been drawing, and a tablet is in his hand.
The room is quite simple, a frieze with angels&rsquo; heads being its only ornament.
Visitors of rank have come to see him&mdash;an elderly magnate and his daughter&mdash;and
have stood long behind him without his noticing their presence; for he
has been thinking of Beatrice, and it is only when his attention is attracted
to them by a friend that he turns round at last. The &ldquo;Beata Beatrix,&rdquo; in
the National Gallery in London&mdash;a picture begun in 1863 and ended in the
August of 1866&mdash;treats of the death of Beatrice &ldquo;under the semblance of a
trance, in which Beatrice, seated in a balcony overlooking the city, is suddenly
rapt from earth to heaven.&rdquo;  In accordance with the description in the <i>Vita</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>
<i>Nuova</i>, Beatrice sits in the balcony of her father&rsquo;s palace in strange ecstasy.
Across the parapet of the balcony there is a view of the Arno and of that
other palace where Dante passed his youth close to his adored mistress, until
the unforgotten 9th of June 1290, when death robbed him of her. A peaceful
evening light is shed upon the bank of the Arno, and plays upon the parapet
with warm silvery beams. Beatrice is dressed in a garment belonging to
no definite epoch, of green and rosy red, the colours of Love and Hope. Her
head rises against a little patch of yellow sky between the two palaces, and
seems to be surrounded by it as by a halo. She is in a trance, has the foreknowledge
of her approaching death, and already lives through the spirit in
another world, whilst her body is still upon the earth. Her hands are touched
by a heavenly light. A dove of deep rose-coloured plumage alights upon
her knees, bringing her a white poppy; whilst opposite, before the palace of
Dante, the figure of Love stands, holding a flaming heart, and announcing to
the poet that Beatrice has passed to a life beyond the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;La Donna Finestra,&rdquo; painted in 1879, and to be counted amongst his
ripest creations, has connection with that passage in the <i>Vita Nuova</i> where
Dante sinks to the ground overcome with sorrow for Beatrice&rsquo;s death, and is
regarded with sympathy by a lady looking down from a window, the Lady
of Pity, the human embodiment of compassion. &ldquo;Dante&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo; is
probably the work which shows the painter at his zenith. The expression
of the heads is profound and lofty, the composition severely mediæval and
admirably complete; and although the painting is laboured, the total impression
is nevertheless so cogent that it is impossible to forget it. &ldquo;The
scene,&rdquo; in Rossetti&rsquo;s own description, &ldquo;is a chamber of dreams, strewn with
poppies, where Beatrice is seen lying on a couch, as if just fallen back in
death; the winged figure of Love carries his arrow pointed at the dreamer&rsquo;s
heart, and with it a branch of apple-blossom; as he reaches the bier, Love
bends for a moment over Beatrice with the kiss which her lover has never
given her; while the two green-clad dream-ladies hold the pall full of May-blossom
suspended for an instant before it covers her face for ever.&rdquo; The
expression of ecstasy in Dante&rsquo;s face, and the still, angelical sweetness of
Beatrice, are rendered with astonishing intensity. She lies upon the bier,
pale as a flower, wrapped in a white shroud, with her lips parted as though
she were gently breathing, and seems not dead but fallen asleep. Her fair
hair floats round her in golden waves. In its vague folds the covering of
the couch displays the marble outlines of the body: and a look of bliss rests
upon the pure and clear-cut features of her lovely face.</p>

<p>This &ldquo;painting of the soul&rdquo; occupied Rossetti almost exclusively in
the third and most fruitful period of his life, when he painted hardly any
pictures upon the larger scale, but separate feminine figures furnished with
various poetic attributes, the deeper meaning of which is interpreted in his
poems. &ldquo;The Sphinx,&rdquo; in which he busied himself with the great riddle
of life, is the only one containing several figures. Three persons&mdash;a youth,
a man of ripe years, and a grey-beard&mdash;visit the secret dwelling of the Sphinx
to inquire their destiny of this omniscient being. It is only the man who
really puts the question; the grey-beard stumbles painfully towards her
cavern, while the young man, wearied with his journey, falls dying to the
earth before the very object of his quest. The Sphinx remains in impenetrable
silence, with her green, inscrutable, mysterious eyes coldly and pitilessly
fixed upon infinity. &ldquo;The Blessed Damozel,&rdquo; &ldquo;Proserpina,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fiammetta,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Daydream,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Bella Mano,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Ghirlandata,&rdquo; &ldquo;Veronica Veronese,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Dis Manibus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Astarte Syriaca&rdquo; are all separate figures dedicated to
the memory of his wife. As Dante immortalised his Beatrice, Rossetti
honoured his wife, who died so early, in his poems and his pictures. He
painted her as &ldquo;The Blessed Damozel,&rdquo; with her gentle, saint-like face, her
quiet mouth, her flowing golden hair and peaceful lids. He represents her as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
an angel of God standing at the gate of Heaven, looking down upon the earth.
She is thinking of her lover, and of the time when she will see him again in
heaven, and of the sacred songs that will be sung to him. Lilies rest upon
her arm, and lovers once more united hover around.</p>

<p>There is no action or rhetoric of gesture in Rossetti. His tall Gothic
figures are motionless and silent, having almost the floating appearance of
visionary figures which stand long before the gaze of the dreamer without
taking bodily form. They glide along like phantoms and shadows, like the
undulations of a blossom-laden tree or a field of corn waving in the wind.
They neither talk nor weep nor laugh, and are only eloquent through their
quiet hands, the most sensuous and the most spiritual hands ever painted,
or with their eyes, the most dreamy and fascinating eyes which have been
rendered in art since Leonardo da Vinci. In the pictures which Rossetti
devoted to her, Eleanor Siddal is a marvellously lofty woman, glorified in
the mysticism of a rare beauty. Rossetti drapes his idol in Venetian fashion,
with rich garments which recall Giorgione in the character of their colour,
and, like Botticelli, he strews flowers of deep fragrance around her, especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span>
roses, which he painted with wonderful perfection and hyacinths, for which
he had a great love, and the intoxicating perfume of which affected him greatly.</p>

<p>This taste for beautiful and deeply lustrous colours and rich accessories
is, indeed, the one purely pictorial quality which this painter-poet has, if one
understands by pictorial qualities the capacity for intoxicating one&rsquo;s self
with the beauty of the visible world. His drawing is often faulty; and his
bodies, enveloped in rich and heavy garments, are, perhaps, not invariably
in accordance with anatomy. What explains Rossetti&rsquo;s fabulous success is
purely the condition of spirit which went to the making of his works&mdash;that
nervous vibration, that ecstasy of opium, that combination of suffering and
sensuousness, and that romanticism drunk with beauty, which pervade his
paintings. When they appeared they seemed like a revelation of a beautiful
land, only one could not say where it existed&mdash;a revelation, indeed, for it
revealed for the first time a world of story which was in no sense fabulous:
there came a romanticism which was something real; a style arose which
seemed as though it were woven of tones and colours, a style rioting in an
everlasting exhilaration of spirit, breaking out sometimes in a glow of flame
and sometimes in delicate, tremulous longing.  Even where he paints a
Madonna she is merely a woman in his eyes, and he endows her with the
glowing fire of passionate fervour, with a trace of the joy of the earth,
which no painter has ever given her before; and through this union of
refined modern sensuousness and Catholic mysticism he has created a new
thrill of beauty. His painting was a drop of a most precious essence, in its
hues enchanting and intoxicating, the strongest spiritual potion ever brewed
in English art. The intensity of his overstrained sensibility, and the wonderful
Southern mosaic of form into which he poured this sensibility with elaborate
refinement, make him seem own brother to Baudelaire.</p>

<p>This tendency of spirit was so novel, this plunge in the tide of mysticism
so enchanting, this delicate, archaic fragrance so overwhelming, that a new
stage in the culture of modern England dates from the appearance of Rossetti.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>
He borrowed nothing from his contemporaries,
and all borrowed from him. There
came a time when budding girls in London
attired themselves like early Italians
from Dante&rsquo;s <i>Inferno</i>, when Jellaby Postlethwaite,
in Du Maurier&rsquo;s mocking skit, entered
a restaurant at luncheon-time, and
ordered a glass of water and placed in it a
lily which he had brought with him. &ldquo;What
else can I bring?&rdquo; asked the waiter. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;
he sighed; &ldquo;that is all I need.&rdquo; There
began that æstheticism, that yearning for the
lily and that cult of the sunflower, which
Gilbert and Sullivan parodied in <i>Patience</i>.
Swinburne, who has tasted of emotions of
the most various realms of spirit, and in his
poems set them before the world as though
in marvellously chiselled goblets, represents
this æsthetic phase of English art in literature.
As a painter, Edward Burne-Jones&mdash;the
greatest of that Oxford circle which
gathered round Rossetti in 1856&mdash;began to
work at the point where Rossetti left off.</p>

<p><i>Sir Edward Burne-Jones</i>, who must
now be spoken of, was born in Birmingham
in August 1833, and was reading theology
in Oxford when Rossetti was there painting
the mural pictures for the Union. Rossetti
attracted him as a flame attracts the moth.
As yet he had not had any artistic training,
but some of his drawings which were
shown to Rossetti by a mutual friend
revealed so much poetic force, in spite of
their embarrassed method of expression, that the painter-poet entered
into communication with him, and allowed him to paint in the
Debating Room of the Union a subject from the Arthurian legends,
&ldquo;The Death of Merlin.&rdquo; The picture met with approval, and Burne-Jones
abandoned theology, became an intimate friend of Rossetti and
the companion of his studies, and went with him to London.
There he designed a number of church windows for Christ Church
Cathedral, Oxford, and in 1864 exhibited his first picture, &ldquo;The
Merciful Knight.&rdquo; Later there followed the triptych &ldquo;Pyramus and
Thisbe&rdquo; and a picture called &ldquo;The Evening Star,&rdquo; a glimmering landscape
through which a gentle spirit in a bronze-green garment is seen to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
float. But none of these works excited much attention. The small picture
exhibited in 1870, &ldquo;Phyllis and Demophoön,&rdquo; was even thought offensive
on account of the &ldquo;sensuous expression&rdquo; of the nymph. So Burne-Jones
withdrew it, and for many years from that time held aloof from all the
exhibitions of the Royal Academy. For seven years his name was never
seen in a catalogue. It was only on 1st May 1877, at the opening of the
Grosvenor Gallery&mdash;founded by Sir Coutts Lindsay, likewise a painter, to
afford himself and his comrades a place of exhibition independent of the
Academy&mdash;that Burne-Jones once more made his appearance before the eyes
of the world. But his pictures, like those of Rossetti, had found their way
in secrecy and by their own merit, and of a sudden he saw himself regarded
as one of the most eminent painters in the country.</p>

<p>His art is the flower of most potent fragrance in English æstheticism, and
the admiration accorded to him
in England is almost greater than
that which had been previously
paid to Rossetti. The Grosvenor
Gallery, where he exhibited his
pictures at this period, was for
a long time a kind of temple for
the æsthetes. On the opening
day men and women of the
greatest refinement crowded before
his works. There was a cult
of Burne-Jones at the Grosvenor
Gallery, as there is a cult of
Wagner at Bayreuth. One had
to work one&rsquo;s way very gradually
through the crowd to see his
pictures, which always occupied
the place of honour in the
principal room of the gallery,
and I remember how helplessly
I stood in 1884 before the first
of his pictures which I saw there.</p>

<p>In a kind of vestibule of early
Gothic architecture there was
seated in the foreground an
armed man, who, in his dark,
gleaming harness and his hard
and bold profile, was like a Lombard
warrior, say Mantegna&rsquo;s
Duke of Mantua, and as he
mused he held in his hand an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>
iron crown studded with jewels; farther in the background, upon a
high marble throne, a maiden was seated, a young girl with reddish
hair and a pale worn face, looking with steadfast eyes far out into another
world, as though in a hypnotic trance. Two youths, apparently pages,
sang, leaning upon a balustrade; while all manner of costly accessories,
brilliant stuffs, lustrous marble, grey granite, and mosaic pavement,
shining in green and red tones, lent the whole picture an air of exquisite
richness. The title in the catalogue was &ldquo;King Cophetua and the Beggar-Maid,&rdquo;
and any one acquainted with Provençal poetry knew that King
Cophetua, the hero of an old ballad, fell in love with a beggar-girl, offered
her his crown, and married her. But this was not to be gathered from the
picture itself, where all palpable illustration of the story was avoided. Nevertheless
a vague sense of emotional disquietude was revealed in it. The two
leading persons of the strange idyll, the earnest knight and the pallid maiden,
are not yet able themselves to understand how all has come to pass&mdash;how she,
the beggar-maid, should be upon the marble throne, and he, the king, kneeling
on the steps before her whom he has exalted to be a queen. They remain
motionless and profoundly silent, but their hearts are alive and throbbing.
They have feeling which they cannot comprehend themselves, and the past
and present surge through one another: life is a dream, and the dream is life.</p>

<p>Everything that Burne-Jones has created is at once fragrant,
mystical, and austere, like this picture. His range of subject is most
extensive. In his <i>Princess</i> Alfred Tennyson had quickened into new
life the legends of chivalry,
and in his <i>Idylls of the King</i>
the tales of the Knights
of the Holy Grail. Swinburne
published his <i>Atalanta
in Calydon</i>, in which he
exercised once more the mysterious
spell of the ancient
drama, while he created in
<i>Chastelard</i>, <i>Bothwell</i>, and
<i>Mary Stuart</i> a trilogy of the
finest historical tragedies
ever written, and showed in
<i>Tristram of Lyonesse</i> that
even Tennyson had not exhausted
all the beauty in old
legends of the time of King
Arthur; while, as early as
1866, he had given to the
world his <i>Poems and Ballads</i>,
dedicated to Burne-Jones. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span>
these works lie the ideas to
which the painter has given
form and colour.</p>

<p>He paints Circe in a saffron
robe, preparing the potion to
enchant the companions of
Ulysses, with a strange light in
her orbs, while two panthers
fawn at her feet. He represents
the goddess of Discord
at the marriage-feast of Thetis,
a ghastly, pallid figure, entering
amongst the gods who are
celebrating the occasion, and
holding the fateful apple in
her hand. He depicts Pygmalion,
the artist King of
Cyprus, supplicating Aphrodite
to breathe life into the
sculptured image of a maiden,
the work of his own hands.</p>

<p>Apart from classical antiquity,
he owes some of his
inspiration to the Bible and
Christian legends, the sublimity
of their grave tragedies,
and the troubled sadness of
their yearning and exaltation.
One of his leading works
devotes six pictures to the
days of creation. An angel&mdash;accompanied
in every case
by the angels of the previous
days&mdash;carries a sphere, in
which may be seen the stars,
the waters, the trees, the
animals, and the first man
and woman, in their proper
sequence. The scene of the
&ldquo;Adoration of the Kings&rdquo; is
a landscape where fragrant
roses bloom in the shadow of
the slender stems of trees,
which rise straight as a bolt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>
The Virgin sits in their midst calm and unapproachable, and in her lap the
Child, who is more slender than in the pictures of Cimabue. The three Wise
Men&mdash;tall, gigantic figures, clad in rich mediæval garments&mdash;approach softly,
whilst an angel floats perpendicularly in the air as a silent witness.</p>

<p>In his picture &ldquo;The Annunciation&rdquo; Mary is standing motionless beside
the great basin of a well-spring, at the portico of her house. To the left the
messenger of God appears in the air. He has floated solemnly down, and it
seems as if the folds of his robes, which fall straight from the body, had hardly
been ruffled in his flight, as if his wings had scarcely moved; with the extremities
of his feet he touches the branches of a laurel. Mary does not shrink,
and makes no gesture. There they stand, gravely, and as still as statues. The
robe of the angel is white, and white that of the Virgin, and white the marble
floor and the wainscoting of the house; and it is only the pinions of the
heavenly messenger that gleam in a golden brightness. A picture called
&ldquo;Sponsa die Libano&rdquo; bore as a motto the words from <i>The Song of Solomon</i>:
&ldquo;Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that
the spices thereof may flow out.&rdquo; The bride, in an ample blue robe, walks
musing beside a stream, upon the bank of which white lilies grow, whilst the
vehement figures of the North and South Winds rush through the air in grey,
fluttering garments.</p>

<p>In addition to his love for Homer and the Bible, Burne-Jones has a passion
for the old Trouvères of the <i>Chansons de Geste</i>, the great and fanciful adventures
of vanished chivalry, Provençal courts of love, and the legends of Arthur,
Merlin, and the Knights of the Round Table. His &ldquo;Chant d&rsquo;Amour&rdquo; is
like a page torn out of an old English or Provençal tale. On the meadow
before a mediæval town a lady is kneeling, a sort of St. Cecilia, in a white
upper-garment and a gleaming skirt, playing upon an organ, the full chords
of which echo softly through the evening landscape. To the left a young
knight is sitting upon the ground, and silently listens, lost in the music, while
a strange figure, clad in red, is pressing upon the bellows of the instrument.
&ldquo;The Enchantment of Merlin,&rdquo; with which he made his first appearance in
1877, illustrated the passage in the old legend of Merlin and Vivien, relating
how it came to pass one day that she and Merlin entered a forest, which was
called the forest of Broceliande, and found a glorious wood of whitethorn,
very high and all in blossom, and seated themselves in the shadow: and
Merlin fell asleep, and when she saw that he slept she raised herself softly,
and began the spell, exactly according to the teaching of Merlin, drawing
the magic circle nine times and uttering the spell nine times. And Merlin
looked around him, and it seemed to him as though he were imprisoned in a
tower, the highest in the world, and he felt his strength leave him as if the
blood were streaming from his veins.</p>

<p>In other pictures he abandons all attempt to introduce ideas, confining
himself to the simple grouping of tender girlish figures, by means of which he
makes a beautiful composition of the most subtle lines, forms, colours, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>
gestures. The &ldquo;Golden Stairs&rdquo; of 1878 was a picture of this description:
a train of girls, beautiful as angels, descended the steps without aim or object,
most of them with musical instruments, and all with the same delicate feet
and the same robes falling in beautiful folds. In this year he also produced
&ldquo;Venus&rsquo; Looking-glass&rdquo;: a number of nymphs assembled by the side of a
clear pool at sunset, in the midst of a sad and solemn landscape, are kneeling
by the water&rsquo;s edge together, reflected in its surface.</p>

<p>Besides these numerous canvases, mention must be made of the decorative
works of the master. For the English church in Rome, Burne-Jones has
designed decorations in a rich and grave Byzantine style, and in England,
where mural decoration has little space accorded to it in churches, there is
all the more comprehensive scope for painting upon glass. Until the sixties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
church windows of this kind were almost exclusively ordered from Germany.
The court depôt of glass-painting in Munich provided for the adornment of
Glasgow Cathedral from drawings by Schwind, Heinrich Hess, and Schraudolph,
and for the windows of St. Paul&rsquo;s from designs by Schnorr, while
Kaulbach was employed for a public building in Edinburgh. In these days
Burne-Jones reigns over this whole province. Where the German masters
handled glass-painting by modernising it like a Nazarene fresco, Burne-Jones,
who has penetrated deeply into the mediæval treatment of form, created a
new style in glass-painting, and one exquisitely in keeping with the Neo-Gothic
architecture of England. His most important works of this description
are probably the glass windows which he designed for St. Martin&rsquo;s Church
and St. Philip&rsquo;s Church in Birmingham, his native town. These labours
of his in the province of Gothic window-painting explain how he came
to his style of painting at the easel: he habituated himself to compose his
pictures with the architectonical sentiment of a Gothic artist. Forced to
satisfy the requisitions of the slender, soaring Gothic style, he came to paint
his tall, straight-lined figures, the composition of which is not triangular in the
old fashion, but formed in long lines as in vertical church windows.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to find prototypes for every one of these works of his.
His sibyls recall Pompeii. His church decoration would never have arisen
but for the mosaics of Ravenna. And those angels in golden drapery with
grave, hieratical gestures in the pictures of the Trecentisti influenced him in
his &ldquo;Days of Creation.&rdquo; Other works of his suggest the Etruscan vases or
the suavity of Duccio. &ldquo;Laus Veneris&rdquo; has the severe classicality of Mantegna
saturated with Bellini&rsquo;s warmth of hue. The &ldquo;Chant d&rsquo;Amour,&rdquo; in
its deep splendour of colour, is like an idyll by Giorgione. And often he heaps
together costly work in gold and ivory like the Florentine goldsmith painters
Pollajuolo and Verrochio. Many of his young girls are of lineal descent from
those slender, flexible, feminine saints of Perugino, painted in sweeping lines
and planted upon small flat feet. Often, too, when he exaggerates his Gothic
principles and gives them eight-and-a-half or nine times the proportion of their
heads, they seem, with their lengthy necks and slim hands fit for princesses,
like younger sisters of Parmigianino&rsquo;s lithe-limbed women; while sometimes
their movements have a more ample grace, a more majestic nobility,
and their lips are moved by the mystical inward smile of Luini, so unfathomably
subtle in its silent reserve. But it is Botticelli who is most often brought
to mind. Burne-Jones has borrowed from him the fine transparent gauze
draperies, clinging to the limbs and betraying clearly the girlish forms in his
pictures; the splendid mantles, flowered and adorned with dainty patterns
of gold; the taste for Southern vegetation, for flowers and fruits, and artificial
bowers of thick palm leaves or delicate boughs of cypress, which he delights
in using as a refined and significant embellishment; from Botticelli he has
borrowed all the attributes with which he has endowed his angels&mdash;rose-garlands
and vases, tapers and tall lilies; even his type of womanhood has an
outward resemblance to that
of the Florentine, with its
long, delicate, oval face framed
in wavy hair, its dreamy eyes
and finely arched brows, its
dainty and rather tip-tilted
nose, and its ripe, delicately
curving mouth slightly opened.
Indeed, Burne-Jones&rsquo;s painting
is like one of those gilded
flower-tables where plants of
all latitudes mingle their tendrils
and their foliage, their
bells and their clusters, their
perfume and their marvellous
glory of colour, in a harmony
artificially arranged. In its
strained archaism his art is
an affected, artificial art, and
would perish as swiftly as a
luxuriant exotic plant, had not
this pupil of the Italians been
born a thoroughbred Englishman,
and this Botticelli risen
from the grave become a true
Briton on the banks of the
Thames.</p>

<p>Burne-Jones stands to Botticelli as Botticelli himself stood to the antique,
or as Swinburne to his literary models. As a graceful scholar, Swinburne
has reproduced all styles: the language of the Old Testament, the forms of
Greek literature, and the naïve lisp of the poets of chivalry. He decorates
his verses with all manner of strange metaphors drawn from the literatures
of all periods. His <i>Atalanta in Calydon</i> is, down to the choruses, an imitation
of the Sophoclean tragedies. In his <i>Ballad of Life</i> he follows the model of
the singers who made canzonets, the writers who followed Dante and the
earliest lyric poets of Italy. In <i>Laus Veneris</i> he tells the story of Tannhäuser
and Dame Venus in the manner of the French romantic poets of the sixteenth
century; <i>Saint Dorothy</i> is a faithful echo of Chaucer&rsquo;s narrative style; and
the <i>Christmas Carol</i> is modelled upon the Provençal Ballades. Even the
earliest lyrical mysteries are reproduced in some poems so precisely that, so
far as form goes, they might be mistaken for originals. But the thought
of Swinburne&rsquo;s verse is what no earlier poet would have ever expressed. It
is inconceivable that a Greek chorus would have chanted any song of the
weariness of man, and of the gifts of grief and tears brought to him at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span>
creation; nor would a Greek have written that Hymn to Aphrodite, the deadly
flower born of the foam of blood and the froth of the sea. And in <i>Hesperia</i>,
where he describes a man who has loved beyond measure and suffered over-much
amid the mad pleasures of Rome, and now sets out, pale and exhausted,
to sail the golden sea of the West until he reach the &ldquo;Fortunate Islands&rdquo;
and find peace before his death, the mood does not reflect the thoughts of the
old world, but those of the close of the nineteenth century; and so it is, too,
in his &ldquo;Hendecasyllabics,&rdquo; where he complains in classically chiselled diction
of the swift decay of beauty and the hidden ills which of a sudden consume
the inward force of life. And Burne-Jones treats old myths with the same
freedom and independence. He takes them up and recasts them, discovers
modern passions lying in the very heart of them, enriches them with a wealth
of delicate shades, borrowed without the smallest ceremony from a new conception
of the world and from the life
of his own time. The human soul
grown old looks back, as it were, upon
the path which it has travelled, and
sees the spirit of its own ripe age
latent in its infancy, recognising that
&ldquo;the child is father of the man.&rdquo;
All the figures in his pictures are
surrounded by a dusk which has
nothing in common with the broad
daylight in which the Renaissance
artists placed the antique world.
There remains what may be called a
residue of modern feeling which has
not been assimilated to the old myth,
a breath of magic floating round
these figures on their career, something
mysterious, an elusive air of
fable. This, indeed, is the pervasive
temperament and sentiment of our
own age. It is our own inward spirit
that gazes upon us as though from an
enchanted mirror with the mien of a
phantom.</p>

<p>And just as he remodels the entire
spirit of old myths, he converts the
figures which he has borrowed into an
artistic form of his own, and, without
hesitation, subordinates them in type
and physical build and bearing to the
new part they have to play.</p>

<p>His pictures differ in their whole character from those of the masters of
the Quattrocento. In Botticelli, also, the young foliage grows green and
flaunts in its exuberant abundance; but in Burne-Jones the vegetation
suggests one of those immense forests in Sumatra or Java. All the plants
are luxuriant and resplendent in colour, and seem to swoon in their own
opulent, plethoric life. Every tree creates an impression of having shot up in
swift and wanton growth under a tropical sun. Rank parasitic plants trail from
stem to stem, and garlands of climbers grow in a luxuriant tangle round the
branches.</p>

<p>And in proportion as the vegetation is luxuriant and sensuous the human
figures are wasted and languishing. The severe charm, rigidity, and demureness
of the Quattrocento is weakened into lackadaisical melancholy. The
dreamy bliss of Botticelli is transposed into sanctified solemnity, delicate
fragility, a voluptuous lassitude, a gentle weariness of the world. When he
paints ancient sibyls, they are touched at once by the unearthly asceticism
of the Middle Ages seeking refuge from the world, and the melancholy,
anæmic lassitude of the close of the nineteenth century. If he paints a Venus
she does not stand out victorious in her nudity, but wears a heavy brocaded
robe, and around her lie the symbols of Christian martyrdom, palms, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
perhaps a lyre. It is not the fairness of her body that makes her goddess of
love, but only the dim mystery of her radiant eyes. She is not the Olympian
who entered into frolicsome adventure with the war-god Mars amid the
laughter of the heavenly gods, for in her conventional humiliation she is
rather like the beautiful dæmon of the Middle Ages who, upon her journey
into exile, passed by the cross where the Son of Man was hanging, and tasted
all the bitterness of the years. In their delicate features his Madonnas have
a gentle sadness rarely found in the Italian masters. Even the angels, who
were roguish and wayward in the Quattrocento, do their spiriting with ceremonious
gravity, and a subdued melancholy underlies their devotional
reverence. In Botticelli they are fresh, youthful figures, lightly girdled,
and with fluttering locks and swelling robes and limber bodies, whether they
float around the Madonna in blissful revelry or look up to the Child Christ
in their rapt ecstasy. But in Burne-Jones they are devout, sombre, deeply
earnest beings, gazing as thoughtfully and dreamily as though they had already
known all the affliction of the world. Their limbs seem paralysed, and their
gesture weary. It is not possible to look at one of his pictures without being
reminded of the Florentines of the fifteenth century, and yet the spectator
at once recognises that they are the work of Burne-Jones. He is even opposed
to Rossetti, his lord and master, through this element of melancholy: the
intoxication of opium is followed by the sober awakening.</p>

<p>Rossetti&rsquo;s women are dazzling and glorious figures of a modern and
deliberately cruel beauty&mdash;sisters of Messalina, Phædra, and Faustina. He
delineates them as luxuriant beings with supple and splendid bodies, long
white necks, and snowily gleaming breasts; with full and fragrant hair, ardent,
yearning eyes, and demoniacally passionate lips. Their mother is the Venus
Verticordia whom Rossetti so often painted. Cruel in their love as one of
the blind forces of nature, they are like that water-sprite with her song and
her red coral mouth dragged from the sea in a fishing-net, as an old French
<i>fabliau</i> tells, and so fair that every man who beheld her was seized by the
love of her, but died when he clasped her in his arms. What they love in man
is his physical strength, his face and sinews of bronze. Only the strong man
who loves them with overpowering madness, like a stormy wind, can bend
them to his will. Swinburne has sung of &ldquo;the lips intertwisted and bitten,
where the foam is as blood,&rdquo; of</p>

<p>But the women of Burne-Jones know that this fervour is no longer to be
found upon the earth. The blood has been sapped, and the fire burns low,
and the glorious, ancient might of love has disappeared. For these women
life has lost its sunshine, and love its passion, and the world its hopes. The
hue of their cheeks is pallid, their eyes are dim, their bodies sickly and without
flesh and blood, and their hips are spare. With pale, quivering lips, and a
melancholy smile or a strangely resigned, intensely grieved look flickering at
the corners of their mouths, they live consumed by sterile longing, and pine
in silent dejection, gazing into vacant space like imprisoned goldfish, or
luxuriate in the vague Fata Morgana of an over-delicate, over-refined, and
bashfully tremulous eroticism&mdash;</p>

<p>Swinburne&rsquo;s first ardent and sensuous volume of lyrics contains a poem,
<i>The Garden of Proserpine</i>: it tells how a man weary of all things human and
divine, and no longer able to support the intoxicating fragrance of the roses
of Aphrodite, draws near with wavering steps to the throne where calm Proserpine
sits silent, crowned with cold white flowers. And in the same way
Rossetti&rsquo;s flaming and quivering passion and his volcanic desire end in Burne-Jones
with sad resignation.</p>

<p>Whilst Christianity and Hellenism mingle in the figures of Burne-Jones, a
division of labour is noticeable amongst the following artists: some addressed
themselves exclusively to the treatment of ancient subjects, others to ecclesiastical
romantic painting in the style of the Quattrocento, and others again
recognised their chief vocation in initiating a reformation in kindred provinces
of industrial art.</p>

<p><i>R. Spencer Stanhope</i>, who was at Oxford, like Burne-Jones, and, indeed,
received his first artistic impulses while employed on the elaboration of
Rossetti&rsquo;s mural pictures for the Union, worked even in later days chiefly in the
field of decorative painting, and is, with Burne-Jones, the principal designer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
for the interior decoration of churches in England. His oil-paintings are few,
and in their gracious Quattrocento build they are in outward appearance
scarcely different from those of Burne-Jones. In a picture belonging to the
Manchester Gallery there is a maiden seated amid a flowery meadow, while a
small Cupid with red pinions draws near to her; the landscape has an air
of peace and happiness. Another picture&mdash;probably inspired by Catullus&rsquo;
<i>Lament for Lesbia&rsquo;s Sparrow</i>&mdash;displays a girl sitting upon an old town wall
with a little dead bird. &ldquo;The Temptation of Eve&rdquo; is like a brilliantly coloured
mediæval miniature, painted with the greatest <i>finesse</i>. As in the woodcut
in the Cologne Bible, Paradise is enclosed with a circular red wall. Eve is
like a slim, twisted Gothic statue. Like Burne-Jones, Stanhope is always
delicate and poetic, but he is less successful in setting upon old forms of art
the stamp of his individuality, and thus giving them new life and a character
of their own. In their severe, archæological character his pictures have
little beyond the affectation of a style which has been arrived at through
imitation.</p>

<p>The third member of this Oxford Circle, the poet <i>William Morris</i>, has
exercised great influence
over English taste by the
institution of an industrial
establishment for embroidery,
painting upon glass,
and household decoration.
Keeping in mind that close
union which existed in the
fifteenth century between
art and the manual crafts,
he and certain of his
disciples did not hesitate
to provide designs for decorative
stuffs, wall-papers,
furniture, and household
embellishments of every
description. They were
largely indebted to the
Japanese, to say nothing
of the old Italians, though
they succeeded in creating
a thoroughly modern and
independent style, in spite
of all they borrowed. The
whole range of industrial
art in England received a
new lease of life, and household
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span>
decoration became
blither and more cheerful
in its appearance. Only
light, delicate, and finely
graduated colours were
allowed to predominate,
and they were combined
with slender, graceful, and
vivacious form. The heavy
panelling which was popular
in the sixties gave way
to bright papers ornamented
with flowers; narrow panes
made way for large plate-glass
windows with light
curtains, in which long-stemmed
flowers were entwined
in the pattern.
Slim pillars supported cabinets
painted in exquisite
hues or gleaming with
lacquer-work and enamel.
Seats were ornamented with
soft cushions shining in all
the delicate splendour of
Indian silks. And the pre-Raphaelite
style of ornamentation
was even extended to the embellishment of books, so that England
created the modern book, at a time when other nations adhered altogether to
the imitation of old models.</p>

<p>In his early years <i>Arthur Hughes</i> attracted much attention by an Ophelia,
a delicate, thoroughly English figure of soft pre-Raphaelite grace; but in
later years he rarely got beyond sentimental Renaissance maidens suggestive
of Julius Wolff, and humorous work in the style of <i>genre</i>.</p>

<p><i>J. N. Strudwick</i>, who worked first under Spencer Stanhope and then under
Burne-Jones, was more consistent in his fidelity to the pre-Raphaelite principles.
His pictures have the same delicate, enervated mysticism, and the same
thoughtful, dreamy poetry, as those of his elders in the school. By preference
he paints slender, pensive girlish figures, with the sentiment of Burne-Jones,
taking his motive from some passage in a poet. In a picture called &ldquo;Elaine&rdquo;
the heroine is mournfully seated in a lofty room of a mediæval palace. Another
of his works reveals three girls occupied with music. Or a knight strewn
with roses lies asleep in a maiden&rsquo;s lap. Or again, there is St. Cecilia standing
with her Seraphina before a Roman building. Strudwick does not possess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
the spontaneity of his master. The childlike, angular effect at which he aims
often seems slightly weak and mawkish; and occasionally his painting is
somewhat diffident, especially when he paints in the architectural detail
and rich artistic accessories, and stipples with a very fine brush. But his
works are so exquisite and delicate, so precious and æsthetic, that they must
be reckoned amongst the most characteristic performances of the New pre-Raphaelitism.
One of his larger compositions he has named &ldquo;Bygone Days.&rdquo;
There is a man musing over the memories of his life, as he sits upon a white
marble throne in front of a long white marble wall, amid an evening landscape.
He stretches out his arms after the vanished years of his youth, the
years when love smiled upon him; but Time, a winged figure like Orcagna&rsquo;s
<i>Morte</i>, divides him from the goddess of love, swinging his scythe with a
threatening gesture. &ldquo;The Past,&rdquo; a slender matron in a black robe, covers
her face lamenting. In Strudwick&rsquo;s most celebrated picture, &ldquo;The Ramparts
of God&rsquo;s House,&rdquo; there is a man standing at the threshold of heaven, naked as
a Greek athlete. His earthly fetters lie shattered at his feet. Angels receive
him, marvellously spiritual beings filled with a lovely simplicity and revealing
ineffable profundity of soul, beings who partake of Fra Angelico almost as
much as of Ellen Terry. Their expression is quiet and peaceful. Instead
of marvelling at the new-comer, they gaze with their eyes green as a water-sprite&rsquo;s
meditatively into illimitable
space. The architecture in
the background is entirely symbolical,
as in the pictures of
Giotto. A little house with a
golden roof and gilded mediæval
reliefs is inhabited by a dense
throng of little angels, as if it
were a Noah&rsquo;s-ark. The colour
is rich and sonorous, as in the
youthful works of Carlo Crivelli.</p>

<p><i>Henry Holliday</i>, who has of
late devoted himself largely to
decorative tasks, seems in these
works to be the <i>juste-milieu</i> between
Burne-Jones and Leighton.
And the youngest representative
of this group tinged with religious
and romantic feelings is <i>Marie
Spartali-Stillman</i>, who lives in
Rome and paints as a rule pictures
from Dante, Boccaccio, and
Petrarch, after the fashion of
Rossetti.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span></p>

<p>Others, who turned to the treatment
of antique subjects, were led by
these themes more towards the Idealism
of the Cinquecento as regards the
form of their work; and in this way
they lost the severe stamp of the pre-Raphaelites.</p>

<p>In these days <i>William Blake Richmond</i>,
in particular, no longer shows
any trace of having once belonged to
the mystic circle of Oxonians. The
Ariadne which he painted in the old
days was a lean and tall woman with
fluttering black mantle, casting up her
arms in lamentation and gazing out
of those deep, gazelle-like eyes which
Burne-Jones gave his Vivien. Even
the scheme of colour was harmonised
in the bronze, olive tone which marked
the earliest works of Burne-Jones.
But soon afterwards his views underwent
a complete revolution in Italy. Influenced by Alma Tadema in form,
and by the French in colour, he drew nearer to the academic manner, until
he became, at length, a Classicist without any salient peculiarity. The
allegory &ldquo;Amor Vincit Omnia&rdquo; is characteristic of this phase of his art.
Aphrodite, risen from her bath, is standing naked in a Grecian portico,
through which a purple sea is visible. Her maidens are busied in dressing
her; and they are, one and all, chaste and noble figures of that classic grace
and elegant fluency of line which Leighton usually lends to his ideal forms.
In a picture which became known in Germany through the International
Exhibition of 1891, Venus, a clear and white figure, floats down with stately
motion towards Anchises. It is only in the delicate pictures of children
which have been his chief successes of late years that he is still fresh and
direct. Girls with thick hair of a <i>blonde cendrée</i>, finely moulded lips, and large
gazelle-like eyes full of sensibility, are seen in these works dreamily seated
in white or blue dresses against a red or a blue curtain. And the æsthetic
method of painting, which almost suggests pastel work in its delicacy, is in
keeping with the ethereal figures and the bloom of colour.</p>

<p><i>Walter Crane</i> has been far more successful in uniting the pre-Raphaelite
conception with a sentiment for beauty formed upon the antique, Burne-Jones&rsquo;s
&ldquo;paucity of flesh and plenitude of feeling&rdquo; with a measured nobility
of form. Born in Liverpool in 1845, he received his first impressions of art
at the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1857, where he saw Millais&rsquo; &ldquo;Sir Isumbras
at the Ford.&rdquo; The chivalrous poetry of this master became the ideal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>
his youth, and it rings clearly throughout his first pictures, exhibited in 1862.
One of these has as its subject &ldquo;The Lady of Shalott&rdquo; approaching the shore
of her mysterious island in a boat, and the other St. George slaying the dragon.
Meanwhile, however, he had come to know Walker, through W. J. Linton,
the wood-engraver, for whom he worked from 1859 to 1862, and the former
led him to admire the beauty of the sculptures of the Parthenon. After this
he passed from romantic to antique subjects, and there is something notably
youthful, a fresh bloom as of old legends, in these compositions, which recall
the sculpture of Phidias. &ldquo;The Bridge of Life,&rdquo; belonging to the year 1875,
was like an antique gem or a Grecian bas-relief. At the Paris World Exhibition
of 1878 he had a &ldquo;Birth of Venus,&rdquo; noble and antique in composition,
and of a severity of form which suggested Mantegna. The suave and poetic
single figures which he delights in painting are at once Greek and English:
girls, with branches of blossom, in white drapery falling into folds, and enveloping
their whole form while indicating every line of the body. His &ldquo;Pegasus&rdquo;
might have come straight from the frieze of the Parthenon. &ldquo;The Fleeting
Hours&rdquo; at once recalls Guido Reni&rsquo;s &ldquo;Aurora&rdquo; and Dürer&rsquo;s apocalyptic riders.</p>

<p>Later he turned to decorative
painting, like all the
representatives of the pre-Raphaelite
group. He is one
of the most original designers
for industrial work in tapestry,
next to Morris the
most influential leader of the
English arts and crafts, and
he has collaborated in founding
that modern naturalistic
tendency of style which will
be the art of the future. His
designs are always based
upon naturalistic motives&mdash;the
English type of womanhood
and the English splendour
of flowers. There
always predominates a sensitive
relationship between
the æsthetic character of the
forms and their symbolical
significance. He always
adapts an object of nature
so that it may correspond
in style with the material in
which he works. The way
in which he makes use of the noblest
models of antiquity and of the Renaissance,
and yet immediately transposes
them into an English key of sentiment
and into available modern forms, is
entirely peculiar. And last, but not
least, he is a marvellous illustrator.
Every one went wild with delight at
the close of the sixties over the appearance
of his first children&rsquo;s books, <i>The
Faerie Queene</i>, <i>The Little Pig who went
to Market</i>, and <i>King Luckiboy</i>, the pictures
of which were soon displayed
upon all patterns for embroidery. And
they were followed by others: after
1875 he published <i>Tell me a Story</i>,
<i>The First of May&mdash;a Fairy Masque</i>,
<i>The Sirens Three</i>, <i>Echoes of Hellas</i>, and
so forth. The two albums <i>The Baby&rsquo;s
Bouquet</i> and <i>The Baby&rsquo;s Opera</i> of 1879
are probably the finest of them all.</p>

<p>In spite of their childish subjects,
the drawings of Walter Crane have
such a monumental air that they have
the effect of &ldquo;grand painting.&rdquo; Without
imitation he reproduces spontaneously
the grace and character of the
primitive Florentines. Some of his
plates recall &ldquo;The Dream of Polifilo,&rdquo;
and might bear the monogram of
Giovanni Bellini. They owe their
origin to a profound Germanic sentiment
mingled with pagan reminiscences;
they are an almost Grecian and yet English art, where fancy like
a foolish, dreamy child plays with a brilliant skein of forms and colours.</p>

<p>That great artist <i>George Frederick Watts</i> stands quite apart as a personality
in himself. In point of substance he is divided from others by not leaning
upon poets, but by inventing independent allegories for himself; and in point
of form by courting neither the Quattrocento nor the Roman Cinquecento,
but rather following the Venice of the later Renaissance. Instead of the
marble precision of Squarcione or Mantegna, what predominates in his work
is something soft and melting, which might recall Correggio, Tintoretto, or
Giorgione, were it not that there is a cooler grey, a subdued light fresco tone
in Watts, in place of the Venetian glory of colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span></p>

<p>As a man, Watts was one of those artists who are only to be found in
England&mdash;an artist who, from his youth upwards, has been able to live for
his art without regard to profit. Born in London in the year 1820, he left
the Academy after being a pupil there for a brief period, and began to visit
the Elgin Room in the British Museum. The impression made upon him by
the sculptures of the Parthenon was decisive for his whole life. Not merely
are numerous plastic works due to his study of them, but several of his finest
paintings. When he was seventeen he exhibited his first pictures, which were
painted very delicately and with scrupulous pains; and in 1843 he took
part in the competition for the frescoes of the Houses of Parliament,
amongst which the representation of St. George and the Dragon was from his
hand. With the proceeds of the prize which he received at the competition
he went to Italy, and there he came to regard the great Venetians Titian and
Giorgione as his kin and his contemporaries. The pupil of Phidias became
the worshipper of Tintoretto. In Italy he produced &ldquo;Fata Morgana,&rdquo; a
picture of a warrior vainly catching at the airy white veil of a nude female
figure which floats past. This work already displays him as an accomplished
artist, though it is wanting in the large, Classical tranquillity of his later paintings.
He returned home with plans demanding more than human energy.
Like the Frenchman Chenavard, he cherished the purpose of representing
the history of the world in a series of frescoes, which were to adorn the walls
of a building specially adapted for the purpose. &ldquo;Chaos,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Creation,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Temptation of Man,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Penitence,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Death of Abel,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Death of Cain&rdquo; were the earliest pictures which he designed for the
series. It was through fresco painting alone, as he believed, that it was
possible to school English art to monumental grandeur, nobleness, and simplicity.
But it was not possible for him to remain long upon this path in
England, where painting has but little space accorded to it upon the walls
of churches, while in other public buildings decoration is not in demand.
Moreover, it is doubtful whether Watts would have achieved anything great
in this province of art. At any rate, a work which he executed for the dining-hall
at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn&mdash;an assembly of the lawgivers of all times from Moses
down to Edward <span class="sc">I</span>&mdash;is scarcely more than a mixture of Raphael&rsquo;s &ldquo;School of
Athens&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Hemicycle&rdquo; of Delaroche. In magnificent allegories in
the form of oil-paintings he first found the expression of his individuality.
Like Turner, Watts did not paint pictures for sale. Yet he has lent one or
other of his pictures to almost every public exhibition. A whole room is
devoted to him in the Tate Gallery. But to know his work thoroughly one
had to go to his house. His studio in Little Holland House contained almost
all his important creations, and was visited by the public upon Saturday and
Sunday afternoons as freely as if it were a museum.</p>

<p>As a landscape painter Watts is a visionary like Turner, though in addition
to the purely artistic effect of his pictures he always endeavoured to awaken
remoter feelings and ideas of some kind or another. His landscape &ldquo;Corsica&rdquo;
reveals a grey expanse,
with very slight vibrations of
tone which suggest that out to
sea a distant island is emerging
from the mist. His &ldquo;Mount
Ararat,&rdquo; a picture entirely filled
with the play of light blue tones,
represents a number of barren
rocky cones bathed in the intense
blue of a pure transparent starry
night. Above the highest peak
there is one star sparkling more
brilliantly than the others. In
his &ldquo;Deluge: the Forty-first
Day,&rdquo; he attempted to depict,
after an interpretation of his
own, the power &ldquo;with which
light and heat, dissipating the
darkness and dissolving the multitude
of the waters into mist and
vapour, give new life to perished
nature.&rdquo; What is actually placed
before the eye is a delicate symphony
of colours which would
have delighted Turner: wild,
agitated sea, clouds gleaming
like liquid gold, and mist behind
which the sun rises in a magical
glow, like a red ball of fire.</p>

<p>In his portraits he is earnest
and sincere. Just as fifty years
ago David d&rsquo;Angers devoted half
a lifetime to getting together a portrait gallery of famous contemporaries,
so to Watts belongs the glory of having really been the historian of his
time. The collection of portraits, many of which are to be seen in the
National Portrait Gallery, comprises about forty likenesses, all of
them half-length pictures, all of them upon the same scale of size, all
of them representing very famous men. Amongst the poets comprised in
this gallery of genius are Alfred Tennyson, Robert Browning, Matthew Arnold,
Swinburne, William Morris, and Sir Henry Taylor; amongst prose-writers,
Carlyle, John Stuart Mill, Lecky, Motley, and Leslie Stephen; amongst statesmen,
Gladstone, Sir Charles Dilke, the Duke of Argyll, Lord Salisbury, Lord
Shaftesbury, Lord Lyndhurst, and Lord Sherbrooke; amongst the leaders of
the clergy, Dean Stanley, Dean Milman, Cardinal Manning, and Dr. Martineau;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span>
amongst painters, Rossetti, Millais, Leighton, Burne-Jones, and Calderon;
and amongst notable foreigners, Guizot, Thiers, Joachim the violinist, and
many others. In the matter of technique Watts is excelled by many of the
French. His portraits have something heavy, nor are they eminent either
for softness of modelling, or for that momentary and animated effect peculiar
to Lenbach. But few portraits belonging to the nineteenth century have the
same force of expression, the same straightforward sureness of aim, the same
grandeur and simplicity. Before each of the persons represented one is able
to say, That is a painter, that a poet, and that a scholar. All the self-conscious
dignity of a President of the Royal Academy is expressed in the picture
of Leighton, and his look is as cold as marble; while the eyes of Burne-Jones
seem mystically veiled, as though they were gazing into the past. Indeed,
the way in which Watts grasps his characters is masterly beyond conception.
Amongst the old painters Tintoretto and Moroni might be compared with him
most readily, while Van Dyck is the least like him of all.</p>

<p>In opposition to the poetic fantasy of Burne-Jones dallying with legendary
lore, an element of brooding thought is characteristic of the large compositions
of Watts, a meditative absorption in ideas which provoke the intellect
to further activity by their mysterious allegorical suggestions. Just as he
makes an approach to the old Venetians in external form, he is divided from
them in the inward burden of his work by a severity and hardiness characteristic
of the Northern spirit, a predominance of idea seldom met with amongst
Southern masters, and a profoundly sad way of thought in which one sees
the stamp of the nineteenth century. Apart from the purely artistic effect
of his work, he tried to make his pictures serve as a stimulus to deeper thought
and meditation: &ldquo;The end of art,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;must be the exposition of
some weighty principle of spiritual significance, the illustration of a great
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Spirit of Christianity,&rdquo; the only one of his works which has a religious
tone, displays a youth throned upon the clouds, with children nestling at his
feet. His powerful head is bent upwards, and his right hand opened wide.
In &ldquo;Orpheus and Eurydice&rdquo; he has chosen the moment when Orpheus turns
round to behold Eurydice turning pale and sinking to the earth, to be once
more swallowed by Hades. The lyre drops from his hands, and with a gesture
of despair he draws the form of his wife to his heart in a last, eternal embrace.
&ldquo;Artemis and Endymion&rdquo; is a scene in which a tall female figure in silvery
shining vesture bends over the sleeping shepherd, throwing herself into the
curve of a sickle.</p>

<p>But, as a rule, he neither makes use of Christian nor of ancient ideas, but
embodies his own thoughts. In &ldquo;The Illusions of Life,&rdquo; a picture belonging
to the year 1847, beautiful, dreamy figures hover over a gulf, spreading at
the verge of existence. At their feet lie the shattered emblems of greatness
and power, and upon a small strip of the earth hanging over an abyss those
illusions are visible which have not yet been destroyed: Glory, in the shape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
of a knight in harness, chases the bubble of resounding fame; Love is symbolised
by a pair who are tenderly embracing; Learning, by an old man poring
over manuscripts in the dusk; Innocence, by a child grasping at a butterfly.
&ldquo;The Angel of Death&rdquo; is a picture of a winged and mighty woman throned
at the entrance of a way which leads to eternity. Upon her knees there rests,
covered with a white cloth, the corpse of a new-born child. Men and women
of every station lay reverently down at the feet of the angel the symbols of
their dignity and the implements of their earthly toil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love and Death&rdquo; represents the two great sovereigns of the world
wrestling together for a human life. With steps which have a mysterious
majesty, pallid Death draws near, demanding entrance at the door of a house,
whilst Love, a slight, boyish figure with bright wings, places himself in the
way; but with one great, irresistible gesture the mighty genius of Death
sweeps the shrinking child to one side. In another picture, &ldquo;Love and Life,&rdquo;
the genius of Love, in the form of a slim, powerful youth, helps poor, weak,
clinging Life, a half-grown, timid, faltering girl, to clamber up the stony path
of a mountain, over which the sun rises golden. &ldquo;Hope&rdquo; is a picture in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>
which a tender spirit, bathed in the blue mist, sits upon the globe, blindfold,
listening in bliss to the low sound vibrating from the last string of her harp.
&ldquo;Mammon&rdquo; is embodied by Watts in a coarse and bloated satyr brutally
setting his heel upon a youth and a young girl, as upon a footstool.</p>

<p>In 1893, when the committee of the Munich Exhibition were moved by
the writings of Cornelius Gurlitt to have some of these works sent over to
Germany, a certain disappointment was felt in artistic circles. And any
one who is accustomed to gauge pictures by their technique is justified in
missing the genuine pictorial temperament in Watts. The sobriety of his
scheme of colour, his preference for subdued tones, his distaste for all &ldquo;dexterity&rdquo;
and freedom from all calculated refinement, are not in accord with
the desires of our time. Even his sentiment is altogether opposed to that
which predominates in the other New Idealists. Burne-Jones and Rossetti
found sympathy because their repining lyricism, their psychopathic subtlety,
their wonderful mixture of archaic simplicity and <i>décadent hautgoût</i>, stand in
direct touch with the present. Watts&rsquo; pictures seem cold and wanting in
temperament because he made no appeal to the vibrating life of the nerves.</p>

<p>But the same sort of criticism was written by the younger generation
in Germany, seventy years ago, on the works of Goethe, which have, none
the less, remained fresher than those of Schlegel and Tieck. What is modern
is not always the same as what is eternally young. And if one endeavours,
disregarding the current of the age, to approach Watts as though he were an
old master, one feels an increasing sense of the probability that amongst all
the New Idealists of the present he has, next to Boecklin, the best prospect
of becoming one. In spite of all its independence of spirit, the art of Burne-Jones
has an affected mannerism in its outward garb. The sentiment of it
is free, but the form is confined in the old limits. And it is not impossible
that later generations, to whom his specifically modern sentiment will appeal
more and more faintly, may one day rank him, on account of his archaism
in drawing, as much amongst the eclectics as Overbeck and Führich are held
to be at the present time. But that can never happen to Watts. His works
are the expression of an artist who is as little dependent upon the past as
upon the momentary tendencies of the present. His articulation of form has
nothing in common with the lines of beauty of the antique, or the Quattrocento,
or the Cinquecento. It is a thing created by himself and to himself
peculiar. He needs no erudition, and no attributes and symbols borrowed
from the Renaissance, to body forth his allegories. With him there begins
a new power of creating types; and his figure of Death&mdash;that tall woman,
clad in white, with hollow cheeks, livid face, and lifeless sunken eyes&mdash;is no
less cogent than the genius with the torch reversed or the burlesque skeleton
of the Middle Ages. Moreover, there is in his works a trace of profundity
and simple grandeur which stands alone in our own period. It is precisely
our more sensitive nervous system which divides us from the old painters,
and has generally given the artistic productions of our day a disturbed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
capricious, restless, and overstrained character, making them inferior to those
of the old masters.</p>

<p>Watts is, perhaps, the only painter who can bear comparison with them
in every respect. Here is a man who has been able to live in himself far
away from the bustle of exhibitions, a man who worked when he was old
as soundly and freshly as when he was young, a man, also, who is always
simple in his art, lucid, earnest, grandiose, impressive, and of monumental
sublimity. Though he shows no trace of imitation he might have come
straight from the Renaissance, so deep is his sense of beauty, so direct and so
condensed his power of giving form to his ideas. And amongst living painters
I should find it impossible to name a single one who could embody such a
scene as that of &ldquo;Love and Death&rdquo; so calmly, so entirely without rhetorical
gestures and all the tricks of theatrical management. There is the mark
of style about everything in Watts, and it is no external and borrowed style,
but one which is his own, a style which a notable man, a thinker and a poet,
has fashioned for the expression of his own ideas. That is what makes him a
master of contemporary painting and of the painting of all times. And that
is what will, perhaps, render him, in the eyes of later generations, one of the
greatest men of our time.</p>

<p class="center chap">CHAPTER XXXIII</p>

<p class="center chap2">THE NEW IDEALISM IN FRANCE AND GERMANY</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">A similar</span> change of taste occurred in France. Just as the Impressionists
had held modernity alone in high honour, so now awoke the
longing after the faded lustre of a bygone age of beauty. The younger
generation in literature began to do homage to their spiritual ancestors not
in Zola but in Charles Baudelaire, that abstracter of the quintessence; and
similarly in the province of art there came to the fore two of the older masters
who until then had been relegated to the background.</p>

<p>In pictorial art <i>Gustave Moreau</i> is equivalent to Charles Baudelaire.
Certain of the strange and fascinating poems in the <i>Fleurs du Mal</i> strike alone
the same note of sentiment as the tortured, subtilised, morbid, but mysterious
and captivating creations of Moreau; and his figures, like those of Baudelaire,
live in a mysterious world, and stimulate the spirit like eternal riddles.
Every one of his works stands in need of a commentary; every one of them
bears witness to a profound and peculiar activity of mind, and every one of
them is full of intimate reveries. Every agitation of his inward spirit takes
shape in myths of hieratical strangeness, in mysterious hallucinations, which
he sets in his pictures like jewels. He gives ear to dying strains, rising faintly,
inaudible to the majority of men. Marvellous beings pass before him, fantastic
and yet earnest; forms of legendary story hover through space upon strange
animals; a fabulous hippogriff bears him far away to Greece and the East, to
vanished worlds of beauty. Upon the journey he beholds Utopias, beholds
the Fortunate Islands, and visits all lands, borne upon the pinions of a dream.
An age which went wild over Cabanel and Bouguereau could not possibly be
in sympathy with him. The Naturalists, also, looked upon him as a singular
being; it was much as if an Indian magician whose robe shone in all the hues
of the rainbow had suddenly made his appearance at a ball, amongst men
in black evening dress. It is only since the mysterious smile of Leonardo&rsquo;s
feminine figures has once more drawn the world beneath its spell that the
spirit of Moreau&rsquo;s pictures has become a familiar thing. Even his schooling
was different from that of his contemporaries. He was the only pupil of
that strange artist Théodore Chassériau, and Chassériau had directed him to
the study of Bellini, Mantegna, Leonardo da Vinci, and all those enchanting
primitive artists whose enchanting female figures are seen to move through
mysterious black and blue landscapes. He was then seized with an enthusiasm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span>
for the hieratical art of India. And he was also affected by old German
copper-engraving, old Venetian pottery, painting upon vases and enamel,
mosaics and niello work, tapestries and old Oriental miniatures. His exquisite
and expressive style, which, at a time when the flowing Cinquecento manner
was in vogue, made an unpleasant effect by its archaic angularity, was the
result of the fusion of these elements.</p>

<p>When he appeared, the special characteristic of French art was its seeking
after violent agitations of the spirit, <i>émotions fortes</i>. The spirit was to be
roused by stormy vehemence, as a relaxed system is braced by massage. But
the generation at the close of the nineteenth century wanted to be soothed
rather than stirred by painting. It could not endure shrill cries, loud, emphatic
speech, or vehement gestures. It desired subdued and refined emotions,
and Moreau&rsquo;s distinction is that he was the first to give expression to this
weary <i>décadent</i> humour. In his work a complete absence of motion has
taken the place of the striding legs, the attitudes of the fencing-master, the
arms everlastingly raised to heaven, and the passionately distorted faces
which had reigned in French painting since David. He makes spiritual
expression his starting-point, and not scenic effect; he keeps, as it were,
within the laws which rule over classical sculpture, where vehemence was only
permitted to intrude from the period of decline, from the Pergamene reliefs,
the Laocoön, and the Farnese Bull. Everything bears the seal of sublime
peace; everything is inspired by inward life and suppressed passion. Even
when the gods fight there are no mighty gestures; with a mere frown they
can shake the earth like Zeus.</p>

<p>His spiritual conception of the old myths is just as peculiar as his grave
articulation of form; it is a conception such as earlier generations could not
have, one which alone befits the spiritual condition of the close of the nineteenth
century. During the most recent decades archæological excavations
and scientific researches have widened and deepened our conceptions of the
old mythology in a most unexpected manner. Beside the laughter of the
Grecian Pan we hear the sighs and behold the convulsions of Asia, in her
anguish bearing gods, who perish young like spring flowers, in the loving arms
of Oriental goddesses. We have heard of chryselephantine statues covered
with precious stones from top to bottom; and we know the graceful terra-cotta
figures of Tanagra. Before there was a knowledge of the Tanagra
statuettes no archæologist could have believed that the Eros of Hesiod was
such a charming, wayward little rascal. Before the discovery of the Cyprus
statues no artist would have ventured to adorn a Grecian goddess with flowers,
pins for the head, and a heavy tiara. Prompted by these discoveries, Moreau
has been swayed by strangely rich inspirations. He is said to have worked
in his studio as in a tower opulent with ivory and jewels. He has a delight
in arraying the figures of his legends in the most costly materials, as the discoveries
at Cyprus give him warrant for doing, in painting their robes in the
deepest and most lustrous hues, and in being almost too lavish in his manner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>
of adorning their arms and breasts. Every figure of his is a glittering idol,
enveloped in a dress of gold brocade embroidered with precious stones. His
love of ornamentation is even extended to his landscapes. They are improbable,
far too fair, far too rich, far too strange to exist in the actual world,
but they are in close harmony with the character of these sumptuously clad
figures which wander in them like the mystic and melancholy shapes of a
dream. The capricious generation that lived in the Renaissance occasionally
handled classical subjects in this manner, but there is the same difference
between Filippino Lippi and Gustave Moreau as there is between Botticelli
and Burne-Jones: the former, like Shakespeare in the <i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream</i>, transformed the antique into a blithe and fantastic fairy world, whereas
that fire of yearning romance which once flamed from poor Hölderlin&rsquo;s poet
heart burns in the pictures of Moreau.</p>

<p>His &ldquo;Orpheus&rdquo; is one of his most characteristic and beautiful works.
He has not borrowed the composition from antique tragedy. The drama
is over. Orpheus has been torn asunder by the Mænads, and the limbs of
the poet lie scattered over the icy fields of the hyperborean lands. His head,
borne upon his lyre now for ever mute, has been cast upon the shore of Erebus.
Nature seems to sleep in mysterious peace. Around there is nothing to be
seen but still waters and pallid light, nothing to be heard but the tone of a
small shrill flute, played by a barbarian shepherd sitting on the cliff. A
Thracian girl, whose hair is adorned with a garland, and whose look is earnest,
has taken up the head of the singer and regards it long and quietly. Is it
merely pity that is in her eyes? A romantic Hellenism, a profound melancholy
underlies the picture, and the old story closes with a cry of love. In
his &ldquo;&OElig;dipus and the Sphinx&rdquo; of 1864, and his &ldquo;Heracles&rdquo; of 1878, he treated
battle scenes, the heroic struggle between man and beast, and in these pictures,
also, there is no violence, no vehemence, no movement. In a terrible silence
the two antagonists exchange looks in his &ldquo;&OElig;dipus and the Sphinx,&rdquo; while
their breath mingles. Like a living riddle, the winged creature gazes upon
the stranger, but the youth with his long locks stands so composedly before
her that the spectator feels that he must know the decisive word.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;Helen upon the Walls of Troy&rdquo; the figure of the enchantress, as
she stands there motionless, clad in a robe glittering with brilliant stones
and diamonds like a shrine, is seen to rise against the blood-red horizon as
though it were a statue of gold and ivory. Like a queen of spades, she holds
in her hand a large flower. Heaps of bodies pierced with arrows lie at her
feet. But she has no glance of pity for the dying whose death-rattle greets
her. Her wide, apathetic eyes are fixed upon vacancy. She sees in the gold
of the sunset the smoke ascending from the Grecian camp. She will embark
in the fair ship of Menelaus, and return in triumph to Hellas, where new
love shall be her portion. And the looks of the old men fasten upon her in
admiration. &ldquo;It is fitting that the Trojans and the Achæans fight for such a
woman.&rdquo; Helen in her blond voluptuous beauty is transformed beneath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>
the hands of Moreau into Destiny
stalking over ground saturated with
blood, into the Divinity of Mischief&mdash;a
divinity that, without knowing
it, poisons everything that comes
near her, or that she sees or touches.</p>

<p>In his &ldquo;Galatea&rdquo; Moreau&rsquo;s love
of jewels and enamel finds its
highest triumph. Galatea&rsquo;s grotto
is one large, glittering casket.
Flowers made from the sun, and
leaves from the stars, and branches
of coral stretch forth their boughs
and open their cups. And as the
most brilliant jewel of all, there
rests in the holy of holies the
radiant form of the sleeping Galatea,
a kind of Greek Susanna, watched
by the staring, adamantine eye of
Polyphemus.</p>

<p>And just as he bathes these
Grecian forms in the dusk of a
profound romantic melancholy, so
in Moreau&rsquo;s pictures the figures of
the Bible are tinged with a shade
of Indian Buddhism, a pantheistic
mysticism which places them in a
strange modern light. In his
&ldquo;David&rdquo; he represents in a quiet
and peaceful way the entry of a human soul into Nirvana. The aged king
sits dreaming upon his gorgeous throne, and an angel watches in shining
beauty beside this phantom, the flame of whose life is slowly sinking. A
curious light falls upon him from the sky. The light of the evening horizon
shines faint between the pillars, and the spectator feels that it is the end of a
long day. His pictures of 1878 dealing with Salome, in their strange sentiment&mdash;suggestive
of an opium vision&mdash;are like a paraphrase of Heine&rsquo;s poem
in <i>Atta Troll</i>. In a sombre hall supported by mighty pillars, through which
coloured lamps and stupefying pastil-burners shed a blue and red light, sits
Herod the king, half asleep with hasheesh, wrapped in silk, and motionless
as a Hindu idol. His face is pale and gloomy, and his throne is like a crystal
confessional chair, fashioned with all the riches of the world. Two women
lean at the foot of a pillar. One of them touches the strings of a lute, and a
small panther yawns near a vessel of incense. Upon the floor of variegated
mosaics flowers lie strewn. Salome advances. Tripping upon her toes as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>214</span>
lightly as a figure in a dream, she
begins to dance, holding a tremulous
lotus-flower in her hand. A shining
tiara is upon her head; her body is
adorned with all the jewels which
the dragons guard in the veins of the
earth. Faster and faster and with
a more voluptuous grace she twists
and stretches her splendid limbs;
but of a sudden she starts and
presses her hand to her heart: she
has seen the executioner as he smote
the head of John from the body.&mdash;In
the midst of an Oriental paradise,
the body of the Baptist lies in the
grass; the head has been set upon
a charger, and Salome, like a bloodthirsty
tigress, watches it with looks
of ardent, famished love.</p>

<p>Different as they seem in technique,
there are many points of
contact between the visionary Gustave
Moreau and <i>Puvis de Chavannes</i>,
the original and fascinating creator
of the decorative painting of the
nineteenth century. Where one indulges
in detail, the other resorts to simplification; where the former is
opulent the latter is ascetic; and yet they are associated through inward
sympathy.</p>

<p>Puvis de Chavannes is the Domenico Ghirlandajo of the nineteenth
century. The most eminent mural works which have been achieved in
France owe their existence to him. Wall-paintings from his hand may be
found above the staircase of the museums of Amiens, Marseilles, and Lyons,
in the Paris Panthéon and the new Sorbonne, in the town-halls of Poitiers
and many other French towns&mdash;pictures which it is difficult to describe in
detail, through the medium of pedestrian prose. The two works with which
he opened the decorative series in the museum of Amiens in 1861 are entitled
&ldquo;Bellum&rdquo; and &ldquo;Concordia.&rdquo; In the former warriors are riding over a
monotonous plain. Two smoking pillars, the gloomy witnesses to sorrow and
devastation, cast their dark shadows over the still fields, whilst here and
there burning mills rise into the sombre sky like torches. In &ldquo;Concordia,&rdquo;
the counterpart to this work, there are women plucking flowers, and naked
youths urging on their horses amid a luxuriant grove of laurel. In the Paris
Panthéon he painted, between 1876 and 1878, &ldquo;The Girlhood of St. Geneviève.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>
A laughing spring landscape, filled with the blitheness of May,
spreads beneath the bright sky of the Isle de France. Calm figures move
in it, men and women, children and greybeards. A bishop lays his hand
upon the head of a young shepherdess; sailors are coming ashore from their
barks. &ldquo;The Grove sacred to the Arts and Muses&rdquo; comes first in the decoration
of the Lyons Museum. Upon one side is a thick forest, dark and profound,
and upon the other the horizon is fringed by violet-blue hills and a
large lake reflecting the bluish atmosphere; in the foreground are green
meadows, where the flowers gleam like stars, and trees standing apart, oaks
and firs, their strong, straight stems rising stiffly into the sky. At the foot
of a pillared porch strange figures lie by the shore or stand erect amid the
pale grass, one with her arm pointing
upwards, another musing with
her hand resting upon her chin,
a third unrolling a parchment.
Athletic youths are bringing flowers
and winding garlands. The &ldquo;Vision
of Antiquity&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christian Inspiration&rdquo;
complete the series.
The former of these pictures brings
the spectator into Attica. Locked
by a simple landscape of hills the
blue sea is rippling, and bright
islands rise from its bosom, while
a clear sky sheds its full light from
above. Trees and shrubs are growing
here and there. A shepherd is
playing upon the pan-pipes, goats
are grazing, and five female figures,
some of them nude, the others
clothed, caress tame peacocks in
the tall grass or lean against a
parapet, breathing in the fresh,
cool air. Farther back, at the foot
of a height, is a young woman,
holding herself erect like a statue,
as she talks with a youth, whilst in
the distance at the verge of the
sea a spectral cavalcade, like that
in Phidias&rsquo; frieze of the Parthenon,
gallops swiftly by. In the counterpart,
&ldquo;Christian Inspiration,&rdquo; a
number of friars who are devoted
to art are gathered together in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>216</span>
portico of an abbey church. The walls
are embellished with naïve frescoes
in the style of the Siennese school.
One of the monks who is working on
the pictures has alighted from the
ladder and regards the result of his
toil with a critical air. Lilies are
blooming in a vase upon the ground.
Outside, beyond the cloister wall, the
flush of evening sheds its parting
light over a lonely landscape, whence
dark cypresses rise into the air,
straight as a lance. In the decoration
of the Sorbonne the object was
to suggest all the lofty purposes to
which the place has been dedicated
upon the wall of the great amphitheatre
used for the solemn sessions
of the faculty, and facing the statues
of the founders. Puvis de Chavannes
did this by displaying a throne in a
sacred grove, a throne upon which a
grave matron arrayed in sombre garments
is sitting in meditation. This
is the old Sorbonne. Two genii at
her side bring palm-branches and
crowns as offerings in honour of the
famous minds of the past. Around are standing manifold figures arrayed
in the costumes which were assigned to the arts and sciences in Florence
at the time of Botticelli and Filippino Lippi. From the rock upon which
they are set there bursts the living spring from which youth derives
knowledge and new power. A thick wood divides this quiet haunt,
consecrated to the Muses, from the rush and the petty trifles of life. In a
painting entitled &ldquo;Inter Artes et Naturam,&rdquo; over the staircase of the
museum of Rouen, artists musing over the ruins of mediæval buildings are
seen lying in the midst of a Norman landscape, beneath apple-trees whose
branches are weighed down by their burden of fruit; upon the other side
of the picture there is a woman holding a child upon her knees, whilst another
woman is trying to reach a bough laden with fruit, and a group of painters
look on enchanted with the grace of her simple, harmonious movement.</p>

<p>Puvis de Chavannes is not a virtuoso in technique; for a Frenchman,
indeed, he is almost clumsy, and is sure in very little of the work of
his hand,&mdash;in fact, it is quite possible that a later age will not reckon him
among the great painters. But what it can never forget is that after a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>217</span>
period of lengthy aberrations he restored decorative art in general to its
proper vocation.</p>

<p>Before his time what was good in the so-called monumental painting
of the nineteenth century was usually not new, but borrowed from more
fortunate ages, and what was new in it, the narrative element, was not good,
or at least not in good taste. When Paolo Veronese produced his pictures
in the Doge&rsquo;s Palace or Giulio Romano his frescoes in the Sala dei Giganti in
Mantua, neither of them thought of the great mission of instructing the people
or of patriotic sentiments; they wanted to achieve an effect which should
be pictorial, festal, and harmonious in feeling. The task of painters who
were entrusted with the embellishment of the walls of a building was to waken
dreams and strike chords of feeling, to summon a mood of solemnity, to
delight the eye, to uplift the spirit. What they created was decorative music,
filling the mansion with its august sound as the solemn notes of an organ roll
through a church. Their
pictures stood in need of
no commentary, no exertion
of the mind, no historical
learning. But the
painting which in the
nineteenth century did
duty upon official occasions
and was encouraged
by governments for the
sake of its pedagogical
efficiency was not permitted
to content itself
with this general range
of sentiment; it had to
lay on the colours more
thickly, and to appeal to
the understanding rather
than to sentiment. Descriptive
prose took the
place of lyricism.</p>

<p>Puvis de Chavannes
went back to the true
principle of the old
painters by renouncing
any kind of didactic intention
in his art. In
the Panthéon of Paris,
when the eye turns to
the works of Puvis de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>218</span>
Chavannes after beholding all the admirable panels with which the recognised
masters of the flowing line have illustrated the temple of St. Geneviève,
when it turns from St. Louis, Clovis, Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, and Dionysius Sanctus
to &ldquo;The Girlhood of St. Geneviève,&rdquo; it is as if one laid aside a prosy history
of the world to read the <i>Eclogues</i> of Virgil.</p>

<p>In the one case there are archæological lectures, stage scenery, and histrionic
art; in the other, simple poetry and lyrical magic, a marvellous evocation
from the distant past of that atmosphere of legend which banishes the
commonplace. His art would express nothing, would represent nothing; it
would only charm and attune the spirit, like music heard faintly from the
distance. His figures perform no significant actions; nor are any learned
attributes employed in their characterisation, such as were introduced in
Greece and at the Renaissance. He does not paint Mars, Vulcan, and Minerva,
but war, work, and peace. In translating the word <i>bellum</i> into the language
of painting in the Museum of Amiens he did not need academical Bellonas,
nor sword-cuts, nor knightly suits of armour, nor fluttering standards. A
group of mourning and stricken women, warlike horsemen, and a simple landscape
sufficed him to conjure up the drama of war in all its terrible majesty.
And he is as far from gross material heaviness as from academical sterility.
The reapers toiling in his
painting entitled &ldquo;Summer&rdquo;
are modern in their movements
and in their whole
appearance, and yet they
belong to no special time and
seem to have been wafted
into a world beyond; they
are beings who might have
lived yesterday, or, for the
matter of that, a thousand
years ago. The whole of
existence seems in Puvis de
Chavannes like a day without
beginning or end, a day of
Paradise, unchangeable and
eternal. And very simple
means sufficed him to attain
this transcendental effect: like
Millet, he generalises what is
individual, and tempers what
is presented in nature; antique
nudity is associated in an
unforced manner with modern
costume; a designed simplicity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>219</span>
which has nothing of the academical painting of the nude, is expressed
in the handling of form. Even his landscape he constructs upon
its elementary forms, and by means of its essential, expressive features.
But by a certain concordance of lines, by a distinct rhythm of form, he compasses
a sentiment which is grave and solemn or idyllic.</p>

<p>The Quattrocentisti, especially Ghirlandajo, were his models in this epical
simplicity, and beside Baudry, the deft and spirited decorator of the most
modernised High Renaissance style, he has the effect of a primitive artist
risen from the grave. His pictures have an archaic bloom&mdash;something
sacerdotal, if you will, something seraphic and holy. Often one fancies that
one recognises the influence of old tapestries, to say nothing of Fra Angelico,
but one is at a loss to give the model copied. And what places him like Moreau
in sharp opposition to the old masters is that, instead of their sunny, smiling
blitheness, he too is under the sway of that heavy melancholy spirit which
the close of the nineteenth century first brought into the world.</p>

<p>When he, a countryman of Flandrin and Chenavard, began his career
under Couture over half a century ago, the world did not understand his
pictures. People blamed the poverty of his palette, asserted that he was too
simple and restricted in his methods of colouring, and he was called a Lenten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
painter, <i>un peintre de carême</i>, whose dull eye noted nothing in nature except
ungainly lines and uniformly grey tones. Women were especially unfavourable
to him, taking his lean figures as a personal insult to themselves. Moreover,
the calm and immobility of his figures were censured, and when he exhibited
his earliest pictures in 1854, at the same time as those of Courbet, he
was called <i>un fou tranquille</i>, just as the latter was christened <i>un fou furieux</i>.
In later years it was precisely through these two qualities, his grandiose
quietude and his &ldquo;anæmic&rdquo; painting, that he brought the world beneath
his spell, and diverted French art into a new course.</p>

<p>As his landscapes know nothing of agitated clouds, nor abruptness nor
the strife of the elements, so his figures avoid all oratorical vehemence. They
are eternally young, free from brutal passions, lost in oblivion. Let him
conjure up old Hellas or the quiet life of the cloister, over figures and landscapes
there always rests a tender sentiment of consecration and dreamy
peace; no violent gesture and no loud tone disturb that harmony of feeling
by any vehement action.</p>

<p>Nor does the colour admit any discord in the large harmony. It is exceedingly
soft and light, although subdued; it has that faint, deadened indecisiveness
to be seen in faded tapestries or vanishing frescoes. Tender
and delicate in its chalky grey unity, which banishes reality and creates a
world of dreams, it is spread around the shadowy figures. It is impossible to
imagine his pictures without this light so pure and yet veiled, this silvery,
transparent air, impregnated with the breath of the Divine, as Plato would
say; it is impossible to imagine them without the delicate tones of these pale
green, pale rose-coloured, and pale violet dresses, which are as delicate as
fading flowers, and without this flesh-tint, which lends a phantomlike and
unearthly appearance to his figures. It is all like a melody pitched in the
high, finely touched, and tremulous tones of a violin; it invites a mood which
is at once blithe and sentimental, happy and sad, banishes all earthly things
into oblivion, and carries one into a distant, peaceful, and holy world.</p>

<p>It was not long before the doctrine of the two souls in <i>Faust</i> was
exemplified in Germany also: from the fertile manure of Naturalism there
sprang the blue flower of a new Romanticism. In Germany there had once
lived Albrecht Dürer, the greatest and most profound painter-poet of all
time; and there, too, even in an unpropitious age that genial visionary Moritz
Schwind succeeded in flourishing. When the period of eclectic imitation
had been overcome by Naturalism, was it not fitting that artists should once
more attempt to embody the world of dreams beside that of actual existence,
and beside tangible reality to give shape to the unearthly foreboding which
fills the human heart with the visions and the cravings of fancy? In that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
age of hope arose the cult of <i>Boecklin</i>, and Germany began to honour in him
who had been so long blasphemed the founder of a new and ardently desired
art.</p>

<p>Burne-Jones, Puvis de Chavannes, Gustave Moreau, and Arnold Boecklin
make up the four-leaved clover of modern Idealism. To future generations
they will bear witness to the sentiment of Europe at the close of the nineteenth
century. All four are more or less of the same age; they all four began their
work in the beginning of the fifties; and they were all different from their
contemporaries and from those who had gone before them. They embodied
the spirit of the future. Boecklin had gone through a process of change as
little as the others. His spirit was so rich that it comprised a century in
itself, and leads us now towards the century to come. He was the contemporary
of Schwind, he is our own contemporary, and he will be the contemporary
of those who come after us. And it were as impossible to derive
his art from that of any previous movement as to explain how he, our greatest
visionary, came to be born in Basle, the most prosaic town in Europe.</p>

<p>His father was a merchant there, and he was born in the year 1827. In
1846 he went to Schirmer in Düsseldorf, and upon Schirmer&rsquo;s advice repaired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
to Brussels, where he copied the old Dutch masters in the gallery. By the
sale of some of his works he acquired the means of travelling to Paris. He
passed through the days of the Revolution of June in 1848, studied the pictures
in the Louvre, and returned home after a brief stay to perform his military
duties. In the March of 1850, when he was three-and-twenty, he went to
Rome, where he entered the circle of Anselm Feuerbach; and in 1853 he married
a Roman lady. In the following year he produced the decorative pictures
in which he represented the relations of man to fire; these had been ordered
for the house of a certain Consul Wedekind in Hanover, but were sent back
as being &ldquo;bizarre.&rdquo; In 1856 he betook himself&mdash;rather hard up for money&mdash;to
Munich, where he exhibited in the Art Union &ldquo;The Great Pan,&rdquo; which
was bought by the Pinakothek. Paul Heyse was the medium of his making
the acquaintance of Schack. And in 1858 he was appointed a teacher at
the Academy of Weimar, by the influence of Lenbach and Begas. During
this time he produced &ldquo;Pan startling a Goat-herd&rdquo; in the Schack Gallery,
and &ldquo;Diana Hunting.&rdquo; After three years he was again in Rome, and painted
there &ldquo;The Old Roman Tavern,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Shepherd&rsquo;s Plaint of Love,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Villa by the Sea.&rdquo; In 1866 he went to Basle to complete the frescoes
over the staircase of the museum, and in 1871 he was in Munich, where &ldquo;The
Idyll of the Sea&rdquo; was exhibited amongst other things. In 1876 he settled
in Florence, in 1886 at Zürich. From 1895 until the day of his death, January
16, 1901, he lived like a patriarch of art in his country house on the ridge of
Fiesole.</p>

<p>Any one who would interpret a theory based upon the idea that an artist
is the result of influences might, while he is about it, speak of Boecklin&rsquo;s
apprentice period in Düsseldorf and Schirmer&rsquo;s biblical landscapes. That
&ldquo;harmonious blending of figures with landscape,&rdquo; which is the leading note
in Boecklin&rsquo;s work, was of course from the days of Claude Lorraine and
Poussin the essence of the so-called historical landscape which found its
principal representatives at a later period in Koch, Preller, Rottmann, Lessing,
and Schirmer. Yet Boecklin is not the disciple of these masters, but stands
at the very opposite pole of art. The art of all these men was merely a species
of historical painting. Old Koch read the Bible, Æschylus, Ossian, Dante,
and Shakespeare; found in them such scenes as Noah&rsquo;s thank-offering, Macbeth
and the witches, or Fingal&rsquo;s battle with the spirit of Loda; and sought amid
the Sabine hills, in Olevano and Subiaco, for sites where these incidents might
have taken place. Preller made the <i>Odyssey</i> the basis of his artistic creation,
chose out of it moments where the scene might be laid in some landscape, and
found in Rügen, Norway, Sorrento, and the coast of Capri the elements of
nature necessary to his epic. Rottmann worked upon hexameters composed
by King Ludwig, and adhered in the views he painted to the historical memories
attached to the towns of Italy. Lessing sought inspiration in Sir Walter
Scott, for whose monks and nuns he devised an appropriately sombre and
mysterious background. Schirmer illustrated the Books of Moses by placing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
the figures in Schnorr&rsquo;s Picture
Bible in Preller&rsquo;s Odyssean
landscape. Whether they
were Classicists appealing to
the eye by the architecture
of form, or Romanticists
addressing the spirit by the
&ldquo;mood&rdquo; in their landscapes,
it was common to all these
painters that they set out
from a literary or historical
subject. They gave an exact
interpretation of the actions
prescribed by their authors,
surrounding the figures with
fictitious landscapes, corresponding
in general conception
to one&rsquo;s notion of the surroundings
of heroes, patriarchs,
or hermits. Their
pictures are historical incidents
with a stage-setting of
landscape.</p>

<p>In Boecklin all this is
reversed. Landscape painter
he is in his very essence, and
he is, moreover, the greatest landscape painter of the nineteenth century,
at whose side even the Fontainebleau group seem one-sided specialists.
Every one of the latter had a peculiar type of landscape, and a special hour
in the day which appealed to his feelings more distinctly than any other.
One loved spring and dewy morning, another the clear, cold day, another
the threatening majesty of the storm, the flashing effects of sportive sunbeams,
or the evening after sunset, when colours fade from view. But Boecklin is
as inexhaustible as infinite nature herself. In one place he celebrates the
festival of spring with its burden of beauty: it is ushered in by snowdrops,
and greeted with joy by the veined cups of the crocus; yellow primroses and
blue violets merrily nod their heads, and a hundred tiny mountain streams
leap precipitately into the valley to announce the coming of spring. In
another, nature shines and blooms and chimes, and breathes her balm in all
the colours of summer. Tulips freaked with purple rise at the side of paths;
flowers in rows of blue, white, and yellow&mdash;hyacinths, daisies, gentians,
anemones, and snapdragon&mdash;fill the sward in hordes; and down in the valley
blow the narcissus in dazzling myriads, loading the air with an overpowering
perfume. But, beside such lovely idylls, he has painted with puissant sublimity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span>
as many complaining elegies and tempestuous tragedies. Here, the
sombre autumnal landscapes, with their tall black cypresses, are lashed by
the rain and the howling storm. There, lonely islands or grave, half-ruined
towers, tangled with creepers, rise dreamily from a lake, mournfully hearkening
to the repining murmur of the waves; and there, in the midst of a narrow
rocky glen, a rotten bridge hangs over a fearful abyss. Or a raging storm,
beneath the might of which the forests bow, blusters round a wild mountain
land which rises from a blue-black lake. Boecklin has painted everything:
the graceful and heroic, the solitude and the waste, the solemnly sublime
and the darkly tragic, passionate agitation and demoniacal fancy, the strife
of foaming waves and the eternal rest of rigid masses of rock, the wild uproar
of the sky and the still peace of flowery fields. The compass of his moods is
as much greater than that of the French Classicists as Italy is greater than
Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>For Italy is Boecklin&rsquo;s home as a landscape painter, and the moods of
nature there are more in number than Poussin ever painted. Grave and sad
and grandiose is the Roman Campagna, with the ruins of the street of
sepulchres, and the grey and black herds of cattle looking mournfully over
the brown pastures. Hidden like the Sleeping Beauty lie the Roman villas
in his pictures, in their sad combination of splendour and decay, of life and
death, of youth and age. Behind weather-beaten grotto-wells and dark
green nooks of yew, white busts and statues gleam like phantoms. From
lofty terraces the water in decaying aqueducts trickles down with a monotonous
murmur into still pools, where bracken and withered shrubs overgrown
with ivy are reflected. Huge cypresses of the growth of centuries stand
gravely in the air, tossing their heads mournfully when the wind blows.
Then at a bound we are at Tivoli, and the whole scenery is changed. Great
fantastic rocks rise straight into the air, luxuriantly mantled by ivy and
parasitic growths; trees and shrubs take root in the clefts; the floods of the
Anio plunge headforemost into the depths with a roar of sound, like a legion
of demons thunder-stricken by some higher power. Then comes Naples,
with its glory of flowers and its moods of evening glowing in deep ruby. Blue
creepers twine round the balustrades of castles; hedges of monthly roses
veil the roads, and oranges grow large amid the dark foliage. Farther away
he paints the Homeric world of Sicily, with its crags caressed or storm-beaten
by the wave, its blue grottoes, and its deep glowing splendours of changing
colour.  Or he represents the inland landscape of Florence with its soft
graceful lines of hill, its fields and flowers, buds and blossoms, and its numbers
of white dreaming villas hidden amid rosy oleanders and standing against
the blue sky with a brightness almost dazzling.</p>

<p>Boecklin has no more rendered an exact portrait of the scenery of Italy
than the Classic masters of France sought to represent in a photographic
way districts in the forest of Fontainebleau. His whole life, like theirs,
was a renewed and perpetual wooing of nature. As a boy he looked down
from his attic in Basle upon the heaving
waters of the Rhine. When he was
in Rome, in 1850, he wandered daily in
the Campagna to feast his eyes upon its
grave lines and colours. After a few
years in Weimar he gave up his post to
gather fresh impressions in Italy. And
the moods with which he was inspired
by nature and the phenomena he observed
were stored in his mind as though
in a great emporium. Then his imagination
went through another stage.
That &ldquo;organic union of figures and
landscape&rdquo; which the representatives of
&ldquo;heroic landscape&rdquo; had surmised and
endeavoured to attain by a reasoned
method through the illustration of passages
in poetry took place in Boecklin
by the force of intuitive conception.
The mood excited in him by a landscape
is translated into an intuition of
life.</p>

<p>In many pictures, particularly those
of his earlier period, the ground-tone
given by the landscape finds merely a
faint echo in small accessory figures.
In such pictures he stands more or less on a level with <i>Dreber</i>, that master
who died in Rome in 1875, and was forgotten in the history of German art
more swiftly than ought to have been the case. Franz Dreber was not one
of those Classicists dispersed over the face of Europe, men who were content
with setting heroic actions in the midst of noble landscapes in the fashion
of Preller; on the contrary, he was the lyricist of this movement, the first
man who did not touch the epical material of old myths in a manner that was
merely scholarly and illustrative, but developed his picture from the original
note of landscape. In his pictures nature laughs with those who are glad,
mourns with those who weep, sheds her light upon the joyful, and envelops
tortured spirits in storm and the terror of thunder. If the golden age is to
be represented, the scene is a soft summer landscape, where everything
breathes peace and innocence and bliss. And the life of those who inhabit
this happy region runs by in blissful peace also. Fair women and children
rest upon the meadow, and gather fruits and pluck roses. If he paints
Ulysses upon the shore of the sea, looking with yearning towards his distant
home, a dull, sultry haze of noon broods over the district, wide and grey
like the hero&rsquo;s yearning. A spring landscape of sunny blitheness, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span>
butterflies sipping at the blossoms of the
trees and sunbeams sportively dallying on
the sea, are the surroundings of the picture
where Psyche is crowned by Eros. And
if Prometheus is represented chained to the
rock and striving to burst his fetters, all
nature fights the fight of the Titan. Lurid
clouds move swiftly through the sky,
ghostly flashes of lightning quiver, and a
wild tempest rakes the mountains.</p>

<p>In Boecklin&rsquo;s earlier pictures the accessory
figures are placed in close relation
with the landscape in a manner entirely
similar. The mysterious keynote of sentiment
in nature gives the theme of the
scene represented. In the picture called
&ldquo;The Penitent,&rdquo; in the Schack Gallery,
a hermit is kneeling half-naked before the
cross of the Saviour upon the slope of a
steep mountain. Troops of ravens fly
screaming above his head, and a strip of
blue sky shines with an unearthly aspect
between the trees, which are bent into
wild shapes. The character of the scene
is terribly severe, and severe and heavy
is the misery in the heart of the man
chastising himself with the scourge in his hand as he kneels there in prayer.
A deep melancholy rests over the picture named &ldquo;The Villa by the Sea.&rdquo;
The failing waves break gently on the shore with a mournful whisper, the
wind utters its complaint blowing through the cypresses, and a few sunbeams
wander coyly over the deep grey of the sky. At the socle of a niche a young
woman dressed in black stands, and, with her head resting upon her hand,
looks out of deeply veiled eyes over the moving tide. In &ldquo;The Spring of
Love&rdquo; the landscape vibrates in lyrically soft and flattering chords. The
budding splendour of blossoms covers the trees luxuriantly, and a rivulet
ripples over the laughing grassy balk. A young man touches the strings of
a lyre and sings; and, joining in his song, a maiden stands beside him
leaning against a bush laden with blossom. In &ldquo;The Walk to Emmaus&rdquo;
the ground-tone is given by a grave evening landscape. The storm ruffles
the tops of the great trees, and chases across the sky the heavy clouds, over
which strange evening lights are flitting. All nature trembles in shivering
apprehension. &ldquo;Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is
far spent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Boecklin&rsquo;s great creations reach a higher level. Having begun by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>233</span>
extending the lyrical mood of a landscape to his figures, he finally succeeded
in peopling nature with beings which seem the final condensation of the life
of nature itself, the tangible embodiment of that spirit of nature whose cosmic
action in the water, the earth, and the air, he had glorified in one of his youthful
works, the frescoes of the Basle Museum. In such pictures he has no forerunners
whatever in the more recent history of art. His principle of creation
rests, it might be said, upon the same overwhelming feeling for nature which
brought forth the figures of Greek myth. When the ancient Greek stood
before a waterfall he gave human form to what he saw. His eye beheld the
outlines of beautiful nude women, nymphs of the spot, in the descending
volume of the cascade; its foam was their fluttering hair, and in the rippling
of the water and spattering froth he heard their bold splashing and their
laughter. The elemental sway of nature, the secret interweaving of her
forces took shape in plastic forms&mdash;</p>

<p>The beings which live in Boecklin&rsquo;s pictures owe their origin to a similar
action of the spirit. He hears trees, rivers, mountains, and universal nature
whisper as with human speech. Every flower, every bush, every flame, the
rocks, the waves, and the meadows, dead and without feeling as they are to the
ordinary eye, have to his mind a vivid existence of their own; and in the same
way the old poet conceived the lightning as a fiery bird and the clouds as the
flocks of heaven.  The stones have a voice, white walls lengthen like huge
phantoms, the bright lights of the houses upon a mountain declivity at night
change into the great eyes with which the spirit of the fell glares fixedly down;
legions of strange beings circle and whir round in the fantastic region. In his
imagination every impression of nature condenses itself into figures that may
be seen. As a dragon issues from his lair to terrify travellers in the gloom
of a mountain ravine, and as the avenging Furies rise in the waste before
a murderer, so in the still brooding noon, when a shrill tone is heard
suddenly and without a cause, the Grecian Pan lives once again for Boecklin&mdash;Pan,
who startles the goat-herd from his dream by an eerie shout, and then
whinnies in mockery at the terrified fugitive.  The cool, wayward splashing
element of water takes shape as a graceful nymph, shrouded in a transparent
water-blue veil, leaning upon her welling urn as she listens dreamily
to the song of a bird. The fine mists which rise from the fountain-head
become embodied as a row of merry children, whose vaporous figures float
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
hazily through the shining
clouds of spring. The secret
voices that live amid the
silence of the wood press
round him, and the phantom
born of the excited senses
becomes a ghostly unicorn
advancing with noiseless step,
and bearing upon his back a
maiden of legendary story
dressed in a white garment.
In the thundercloud lying
over the broad summit of a
mountain and abundant in
blessing rain he sees the huge
body of the giant Prometheus,
who brought fire from heaven
and lies fettered to the mountain
top, spreading over the
landscape like a cloud. The
form of Death stumbling
past cloven trees in rain and
tempest, as he rides his pale
horse, appears to him in a
waste and chill autumnal region, where stands a ruined castle in lurid
illumination. A sacred grove, lying in insular seclusion and fringed with
venerable old trees that rise straight into the air, rustling as they bend their
heads towards each other, is peopled, as at a word of enchantment, with
grave priestly figures robed in white, which approach in solemn procession
and fling themselves down in prayer before the sacrificial fire. The lonely
waste of the sea is not brought home to him with sufficient force by a wide
floor of waves, with gulls indolently flying beneath a low and leaden sky;
so he paints a flat crag emerging from the waves, and upon its crest, over
which the billows sweep, the shy dwellers of the sea bathe in the light. Naiads
and Tritons assembled for a gamesome ride over the sea typify the sportive
hide-and-seek of the waves. Yet there is nothing forced, nothing merely
ingenious, nothing literary in these inventions. The figures are not placed
in nature with deliberate calculation: they are an embodied mood of nature;
they are children of the landscape, and no mere accessories.</p>

<p>Boecklin&rsquo;s power of creating types in embodying these beings of his imagination
is a thing unheard of in the whole history of art. He has represented his
Centaurs and Satyrs, and Fauns and Sirens and Cupids, so vividly and impressively
that they have become ideas as currently acceptable as if they were
simple incomposite beings. He has seen the awfulness of the sea at moments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
when the secret beings of the deep emerge, and he allows a glimpse into the
fabulous reality of their heretofore unexplored existence. For all beings
which hover swarming in the atmosphere around have their dwelling in the
trees or their haunts in rocky deserts, he has found new and convincing figures.
Everything which was created in this field before his time&mdash;the works of Dürer,
Mantegna, and Salvator Rosa not excepted&mdash;was an adroit sport with forms
already established by the Greeks, and a transposition of Greek statues into
a pictorial medium. With Boecklin, who instead of illustrating mythology
himself creates it, a new power of inventing myths was introduced. His
creations are not the distant issue of nature, but corporeal beings, full of
ebullient energy, individualised through and through, and stout, lusty, and
natural; and in creating them he has been even more consistent than the
Greeks. In their work there is something inorganic in the combination of a
horse&rsquo;s body with the head of Zeus or Laocoön grafted upon it. But in the
presence of Boecklin&rsquo;s Centaurs heaving great boulders around them and
biting and worrying each other&rsquo;s manes, the spectator has really the feeling
which prompts him to exclaim, &ldquo;Every inch a steed!&rdquo; In him the nature
of the sea is expressed through his cold, slimy women with the dripping hair
clinging to their heads far more powerfully than it was by the sea-gods of
Greece. How merciless is the look in their cold, black, soulless eyes! They
are as terrible as the destroying
sea that yesterday in its
bellowing fury engulfed a
hundred human creatures
despairing in the anguish of
death, and to-day stretches
still and joyous in its blue
infinity and its callous oblivion
of all the evils it has
wrought.</p>

<p>And only a slight alteration
in the truths of nature
has sufficed him for the
creation of such chimerical
beings. As a landscape
painter he stands with all his
fibres rooted in the earth,
although he seems quite
alienated from this world
of ours, and his fabulous
creatures make the same convincing
impression because
they have been created with
all the inner logical congruity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
of nature, and delineated under close relationship to actual fact with
the same numerous details as the real animals of the earth. For his
Tritons, Sirens, and Mermaids, with their awkward bodies covered with
bristly hair and their prominent eyes, he may have made studies from
seals and walruses. As they stretch themselves upon a rocky coast,
fondling and playing with their young, they have the look of sea-cows
in human form, though, like men, they have around them all manner
of beasts of prey and domestic pets which they caress,&mdash;in one place a
sea-serpent, in another a seal. His obese and short-winded Tritons, with
shining red faces and flaxen hair dripping with moisture, are good-humoured
old gentlemen with a quantity of warm blood in their veins, who love and
laugh and drink new wine. His Fauns may be met with amongst the shepherds
of the Campagna, swarthy strapping fellows dressed in goat-skins after the
fashion of Pan&mdash;lads with glowing eyes and two rows of white teeth gleaming
like ivory. It is chiefly the colour lavished upon them which turns them into
children of an unearthly world, where other suns are shining and other stars.</p>

<p>In the matter of colour also the endeavours of Romanticists of the nineteenth
century reach a climax in Boecklin. When Schwind and his comrades
set themselves to represent the romantic world of fairyland an interdict was
still laid upon colour, and it was lightly washed over the drawing, which
counted as the thing of prime importance. But Boecklin was the first Romanticist
in Germany to reveal the marvellous power in colour for rendering
moods of feeling and its inner depth of musical sentiment. Even in those years
when the brown tone of the galleries prevailed everywhere, colour was allowed
in his pictures to have its own independent existence, apart from its office of
being a merely subordinate characteristic of form. For him green was
thoroughly green, blue was divinely blue, and red was jubilantly red. At the
very time when Richard Wagner lured the colours of sound from music, with
a glow and light such as no master had kindled before, Boecklin&rsquo;s symphonies
of colour streamed forth like a crashing orchestra. The whole scale, from the
most sombre depth to the most chromatic light, was at his command. In his
pictures of spring the colour laughs, rejoices, and exults. In &ldquo;The Isle of
the Dead&rdquo; it seems as though a veil of crape were spread over the sea, the sky,
and the trees. And since that time Boecklin has grown even greater. His
splendid sea-green, his transparent blue sky, his sunset flush tinged with
violet haze, his yellow-brown rocks, his gleaming red sea-mosses, and the white
bodies of his girls are always arranged in new glowing, sensuous harmonies.
Many of his pictures have such an ensnaring brilliancy that the eye is never
weary of feasting upon their floating splendour.</p>

<p>A master who died in Rome some nineteen years ago might have been in
the province of mural painting for German art what Puvis de Chavannes has
become for French. In the earlier histories of art his name is not mentioned.
Seldom alluded to in life, dead as a German painter ten years before his death,
he was summoned from the grave by the enthusiasm of a friend who was a
refined connoisseur four years after the earth had closed over him. Such was
<i>Hans von Marées&rsquo;</i> destiny as an artist.</p>

<p>Marées was born in Elberfeld in 1837. In beginning his studies he had first
betaken himself to Berlin, and then went for eight years to Munich, where he
paid his tribute to the historical tendency by a &ldquo;Death of Schill.&rdquo;  But in
1864 he migrated to Rome, where he secluded himself with a few pupils,
and passed his time in working and teaching.  Only once did he receive an
order. He was entrusted in 1873 with the execution of some mural paintings
in the library of the Zoological Museum in Naples, and lamented afterwards
that he had not received the commission in riper years.  When he had sufficient
confidence in himself to execute such tasks he had no similar opportunity, and
thus he lost the capacity for the rapid completion of a work. He began to
doubt his own powers, sent no more pictures to any exhibition, and when he
died in the summer of 1887, at the age of fifty, his funeral was that of a man
almost unknown. It was only when his best works were brought together at
the annual exhibition of 1891 at Munich that he became known in wider circles,
and these pictures, now preserved in the Castle of Schleissheim, will show to
future years who Hans von Marées was, and what he aimed at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An artist rarely confines himself to what he has the power of doing,&rdquo; said
Goethe once to Eckermann; &ldquo;most artists want to do more than they can,
and are only too ready to go beyond the limits which nature has set to their
talent.&rdquo;  Setting out from this tenet, there would be little cause for rescuing
Marées from oblivion. Some portraits and a few drawings are his only performances
which satisfy the demands of the studio&mdash;the portraits being large
in conception and fine in taste, the drawings sketched with a swifter and surer
hand. His large works have neither in drawing nor colour any one of those
advantages which are expected in a good picture; they are sometimes incomplete,
sometimes tortured, and sometimes positively childish.  &ldquo;He is ambitious,
but he achieves nothing,&rdquo; was the verdict passed upon him in Rome. Upon
principle Marées was an opponent of all painting from the model. He scoffed
at those who would only reproduce existing fact, and thus, in a certain sense,
reduplicate nature, according to Goethe&rsquo;s saying: &ldquo;If I paint my mistress&rsquo;s
pug true to nature, I have two pugs, but never a work of art.&rdquo;  For this
reason he never used models for the purpose of detailed pictorial studies; and
just as little was he at pains to fix situations in his mind by pencil sketches to
serve as notes; for, according to his view, the direct use of motives, as they are
called, is only a hindrance to free artistic creation. And, of course, creation of
this kind is only possible to a man who can always command a rich store of
vivid memories of what he has seen and studied and profoundly grasped in
earlier days. This treasury of artistic forms was not large enough in Marées.
If one buries oneself in Marées&rsquo; works&mdash;and there are some of them in which
the trace of great genius has altogether vanished beneath the unsteady hand of
a restless brooder&mdash;it seems as if there thrilled within them the cry of a human
heart. Sometimes through his method of painting them over and over again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
he produced spectral beings with grimacing faces. Their bodies have been so
painted and repainted that whole layers of colour lie upon separate parts, and
ruin the impression in a ghastly fashion. Only too often his high purpose was
wrecked by the inadequacy of his technical ability; and his poetic dream of
beauty almost always evaporated because his hand was too weak to give it shape.</p>

<p>If his pictures, in spite of all this, made a great effect in the Munich exhibition,
it was because they formulated a principle. It was felt that notes had
been touched of which the echo would be long in dying. When Marées appeared
there was no &ldquo;grand painting&rdquo; for painting&rsquo;s sake in Germany, but mural
decoration after the fashion of the historical picture&mdash;works in which the aim
of decorative art was completely misunderstood, since they merely gave a
rendering of arid and instructive stories, where they should have simply aimed
at expressing &ldquo;a mood.&rdquo; Like his contemporary Puvis de Chavannes in
France, Marées restored to this &ldquo;grand painting&rdquo; the principle of its life, its
joyous impulse, and did so not by painting anecdote, but because he aimed at
nothing but pictorial decorative effect. A sumptuous festal impression might
be gained from his pictures; it was as though beautiful and subdued music
filled the air; they made the appeal of quiet hymns to the beauty of nature,
and were, at the same time, grave and monumental in effect.</p>

<p>In one, St. Martin rides through a desolate wintry landscape upon a slow-trotting
nag, and holds his outspread mantle towards the half-naked beggar,
shivering with the cold. In another, St. Hubert has alighted from his horse, and
kneels in adoration before the cross which he sees between the antlers of the stag.
In another, St. George, upon a powerful rearing horse, thrusts his lance through
the body of the dragon with solemn and earnest mien. But as a rule even the
relationship with antique, mythological, and mediæval legendary ideas is
wanting in his art. Landscapes which seem to have been studied in another
world he peoples with beings who pass their lives lost in contemplation of the
divine. Women and children, men and grey-beards live, and love, and labour
as though in an age that knows nothing of the stroke of the clock, and which
might be yesterday or a hundred thousand years ago. They repose upon the
luxuriant sward shadowed by apple-trees laden with fruit, abandoning themselves
to a thousand reveries and meditations. They do not pose, and they aim
at being nothing except children of nature, nature in her innocence and
simplicity. Nude women stand motionless under the trees, or youths are seen
reflected in the pools. The motive of gathering oranges is several times
repeated: a youth snatches at the fruit, an old man bends to pick up those
which have dropped, and a child searches for those which have rolled away
in the grass. Sometimes the steed, the Homeric comrade of man, is introduced:
the nude youth rides his steed in the training-school, or the commander
of an army gallops upon his splendid warhorse. Everything that Marées
painted belongs to the golden age. And when it was borne in mind that these
pictures had been produced twenty years back or more, they came to have the
significance of works that opened out a new path; there was poetry in the place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
of didactic formula; in the
place of historical anecdote
the joy of plastic beauty; in
the place of theatrical vehemence
an absence of gesticulation
and a perfect simplicity
of line. At a time when
others rendered dramas and
historical episodes by colours
and gestures, Marées composed
idylls. He came as a man
of great and austere talent,
Virgilian in his sense of infinite
repose on the breast of nature,
monastic in his abnegation of
petty superficial allurements,
despite special attempts which
he made at chromatic effect.
Something dreamy and architectonic,
lofty and yet familiar,
intimate in feeling and yet
monumental holds sway in his
works. Intimacy of effect he
achieved by the stress he laid
upon landscape; monumental
dignity by his grandiose and
earnest art, and his calm and
sense of style in line. All
abrupt turns and movements
were avoided in his work.
And he displayed a refinement
entirely peculiar to himself through the manner in which he brought
into accord the leading lines of landscape and the leading lines in his figures.
A feeling for style, in the sense in which it was understood by the old painters,
is everywhere dominant in his work, and a handling of line and composition
in the grand manner which placed him upon a level with the masters of art.
A new and simple beauty was revealed. And if it is true that it is only in
the field of plastic art that he has had, up to the present, any pupil of
importance&mdash;and he had one in Adolf Hildebrandt&mdash;it is, nevertheless,
beyond question that the monumental painting of the future is alone capable
of being developed upon the ground prepared by Marées.</p>

<p>In this more than anything, it seems to me, lies the significance of all these
masters. We must not lay too much stress upon the fact that they dealt with
ideal and universal themes; a healthy art cannot be nourished on bloodless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
ideals, but only on the living essence of its own epoch. We must bear in mind,
however, that a sound artistic principle has been formulated. A glance at the
productions of classic art shows us that the old masters carefully considered
the relation of a picture to its environment. Take, for instance, the Ravenna
mosaics or Giotto&rsquo;s frescoes. They must needs resound in solemn harmony
the whole church through; looked at from any point of view they must make
their presence felt right away in the farthest distance: so both Giotto and the
mosaic artists worked only in broad expressive lines, their forcible colour-schemes
were fitted together in accordance with strict decorative laws. All
naturalistic effects are avoided, all petty detail is left out in the flow of the
drapery as well as in the structure of the landscape. Then the clear outlines
tell out. The pictures must, when viewed from a distance, simultaneously,
in all their lines, carry on the lines of the building.</p>

<p>Later on, in the Netherlands, there arose another style of painting. In
abrupt contrast to the monumental works of the Italian school we have Jan
van Eyck&rsquo;s tiny little pictures painted with a fine point, stroke by stroke, with
the most minute exactitude. Every hair in the head, every vein in the hands,
every ornament in the costume is drawn true to life. Jan van Eyck knew what
he was about with this fine-point style of art, for his pictures did not lay claim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
to any effect from a distance; they were meant to be looked at, like miniatures
in the prayer-books, from the closest point of view possible. They were little
domestic altar-pieces: when anyone wanted to look at them, he drew the
curtain aside and knelt or stood just in front of them. The style of painting
of the later Dutch cabinet pictures is accounted for in the same way. These
paintings were generally placed on an easel, as if to give the spectator a gentle
hint, &ldquo;If you wish to fully appreciate the beauties of this little picture, please
stand right in front.&rdquo; Even when the pictures were meant to adorn the walls,
the minute and dainty style of a Don or a Mieris was appropriate, for the narrowness
of the old Dutch rooms precluded all possibility of the spectator&rsquo;s being
able to stand far away from the picture.</p>

<p>If by chance one of these Dutch artists, Weenix for instance, had to do work
for a Flemish palace, he changed his style forthwith. He recognised the fact
that a picture, to be effective in a large state-room, must differ not only in size,
but in composition and style of painting from one that is meant for a small
parlour. It is undoubtedly this lack of appreciation of the fact that a picture
must be suitable to its surroundings that has robbed the nineteenth century
of any claim to style. What abominable daubs mural painters have foisted
upon us in our public buildings! The literary trend of the time drew away
people&rsquo;s attention from the beauty of form and colour, and centred it upon the
didactic value of the works. Instead of starting from the idea that a picture
should &ldquo;adorn,&rdquo; they covered the
walls with historical genre painting,
never troubling themselves about
decorative effect, and offered the beholder
instructive stories in picture
cards. As to art in the home, well,
we can all of us remember the time
when small photographs and etchings,
instead of being kept in an
album or a portfolio, were put on
the wall, where they looked like
mere spots of dead black and white.
It was the same sort of thing in
galleries and exhibitions, confusion
worse confounded. On one and the
same wall you got the most heterogeneous
collection, cabinet pictures
by Brouwer or Ostade next to an
enormous altar-piece by Rubens, a
gigantic Delacroix flanked by neat
little Meissoniers. In this way the
power of appreciating the significance
of a work of art as part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span>
decoration of a room was totally lost. Surely it is not to be wondered
at that a picture seen close to in an exhibition, bought, taken home, hung
on the wall and looked at from a distance, turns out a meaningless chaos of
dirty-brown.</p>

<p>In the province of mural painting the tendency towards an improvement
set in earliest. In England, France, and Germany, almost simultaneously
efforts began to be made with the object of restoring to mural painting once
more its decorative element. In England Burne-Jones was the first to pay
attention to harmony of style between picture and building. Before his
time English churches were provided with stained-glass windows in a spurious
sort of Cinquecento style that was absolutely unsuited to the building, but
Burne-Jones satisfied the most exacting demands of the English Neo-Gothic
architecture. All his subjects are brought into style with the slender pillars,
the curves of the landscape as well as of the figures harmonise with the
pointed arches of the building. Everything, colour as well as line, is so
simplified that the pictures retain the clearness of their composition when
seen from the farthest possible standpoint. In France, Puvis de Chavannes
travelled by another road to the same goal. The decoration of the Pantheon
was placed in his hands. Before him many artists had done work there,
but the policy of all of them had been to adopt the old style of oil-painting
to mural decoration, and so they adorned the Pantheon as well, though it
was called a Grecian temple, with oil-paintings founded on Raphael or
Caravaggio, mural pictures that would have been far better suited to a church
of the Cinquecento or the <i>baroque</i> period. Puvis was the first to realise that
in the decoration of a building the artist must be strictly controlled by the
style of the architecture; so in his frescoes he avoided all projections, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
roundness, all wavy lines, bends, and curves, and dealt exclusively with groups
of vertical and horizontal lines, that followed the characteristic lines of pillar
and architrave. Similarly in the colours as well as the lines he excluded all
detail that would distract the attention, all confusion of colours that would
disturb the eye, and thereby gave his works the stately and dominant effect
that they produce. Had Fate been kind, poor Hans von Marées might have
won the same significance for Germany as Puvis did for France. Though
individually his works are faulty, they are all informed with a marvellous
feeling for style; one observes how beautifully the lines of the landscape
are made to harmonise with the lines of the figures, and with what a finely
decorative quality the colours are combined.</p>

<p>In a similar manner we must bring our minds to bear upon the problem
of the framed picture in connection with the decoration of a room. Our
rooms are not only lighter
but more spacious than the
old-fashioned Dutch parlours,
with their leaded panes; so it
was merely a hereditary taint
in our painters that made
them cling so long to the
ancestral style of painting, in
spite of the altered conditions
of the lighting and size of
modern rooms. Impressionism
did at any rate bring
colour more into harmony
with the improved lighting of
our rooms; yet in every art
the sins of the fathers are
visited upon their children.
The Impressionists discovered
atmosphere, and so they
denied the existence of lines,
and the outlines vanished
into thin air; they discovered
light, and therefore they likewise
denied the existence of
colours. Then by means of
light the colours were analysed,
and patches of colour
were decomposed into a
heterogeneous conglomeration
of luminous points. The Impressionists
simply revelled in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
the most delicate nuances of vague tones of indefinite colour, and as they
eliminated from their work all significant lines and all strong and frank
colours, they spoilt to a great extent the decorative effect of their pictures
when viewed at a distance: their paintings from that standpoint are often
nothing more than a daub of violet and yellow, without form and void.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<td class="tcr f80 pb2">THE ISLE OF THE DEAD.</td></tr></table>

<p>Thus towards the close of the nineteenth century there came under discussion
a new problem again in the matter of picture painting.  The question
arose as to how decorative qualities might be arrived at in painting pure
and simple. The way seems to be pointed out in the works of Moreau and
Boecklin; the way in which they placed side by side beautiful strong colours
in broad masses, and invariably so as to avoid all discord, and combined the
most conflicting tones into a harmonious whole in a manner which words
fail one to describe.  It was delightful, after having looked so long at
nothing but the subtle, delicate nuances of the Impressionists, to turn again
to these full-toned colours ringing out their deep and mighty harmonies.</p>

<p>It is scarcely to be wondered at that the younger generation of the present
day refused to be bound by the principles of art laid down by their predecessors,
notwithstanding the fact that Moreau, as well as Boecklin, was indebted
to the Quattrocento for the mosaic-like brilliancy of his colours.
Impressionism has discovered a whole range of new colour values by careful
and intelligent study of the influence of light upon colour, and where formerly
we saw ten we now find a hundred. Red, green, blue have lost their meaning
in the category of complex and infinitely differentiated tones. So, as we
advance from a realistic transcript of impressions taken direct from nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
to free, symphonic compositions of the colours to which Impressionism has
opened our eyes, we shall evolve harmonies richer than were ever imagined
before, more melting than we ever dreamed of. This is the goal to which
the efforts of the younger generation are primarily tending. Building upon
the foundations laid by the Impressionists, they seek to ensure for their
pictures both clearness and harmony, by simplification of form, by beauty
of technique, and by subordination of colour to the decorative scheme.
Their confession of faith is comprised in the words of Paterson: &ldquo;A picture
must be something more than garbled Nature: it must please the educated
eye; and only so far as nature gives the painter his material can he or dare
he follow her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center chap">INTRODUCTION</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">By</span> what means was the further development of painting in Europe
brought about under the influence of the principles of the two schools,
the Impressionists and the Decorative-Stylists? The following may supply
the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Realism&rdquo; having led painting from the past to the present, and &ldquo;Impressionism&rdquo;
having broken the jurisdiction of the galleries by establishing
an independent conception of colour for a new class of subjects, the flood of
modern life, which had been artificially dammed, began to pour into art in
all its volume. A whole series of new problems emerged, and a vigorous band
of modern spirits were ready to lay hold upon them and give them artistic
shape, each according to his nature, his ability, and his individual knowledge
and power. After nineteenth-century painting had found its proper field of
activity they were no longer under the necessity of seeking remote subjects.
The fresh conquest of a personal impression of nature took the place of that
retrospective taste which employed the ready-made language of form and
colour belonging to the old masters, as a vocabulary for the preparation of
fresh works of art. Nature herself had become a gallery of splendid pictures.
Artists were dazzled as if by a new light, overcome as though by a revelation
of tones and strains from which the painter was to compose his symphonies.
They learnt how to find what was pictorial and poetic in the narrowest family
circle and amongst the beds of the simplest vegetable garden; and for the first
time they felt more wonder in the presence of reality, the joy of gradual discovery
and of a leisurely conquest of the world.</p>

<p>Of course, <i>plein-air</i> painting was at first the chief object of their endeavours.
Having painted so long only in brown tones, the radiant magic world of free
and flowing light was something so ravishingly novel that for several years
all their efforts were exclusively directed to possessing themselves once more
of the sun, and substituting the clear daylight for the clare-obscure which had
reigned alone, void of atmosphere. In this sunny brightness, flooded with
light and air, they found a crowd of problems, and turned to the perpetual
discovery of new chords of colour. Sunbeams sparkling as they rippled
through the leaves, and greyish-green meadows flecked with dust and basking
under light, were the first and most simple themes.</p>

<p>The complete programme, however, did not consist of painting in bright
hues, but, generally speaking, in seizing truth of colour and altogether renouncing
artificial harmony in a generally accepted tone. Thus, after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span>
painting of daylight and sunlight was learnt, a further claim had still to be
asserted: the ideal of truth in painting had to be made the keynote in every
other task. For in the sun, light is no doubt white, but in the recesses of the
forest, in the moonshine, or in a dim place, it shines and is at the same time
charged with colour. Night, or mist, with its hovering and pervasive secrets,
is quite as rich in beauties as the radiant world of glistening sunshine. After
seeing the summer sun on wood and water, it was a relief for the eye to behold
the subdued, soft, and quiet light of a room. Upon the older and rougher
painting of free light there followed a preference for dusk, which has a softness
more picturesque, a more tender harmony of colours, and more geniality than
the broad light of day. Artists studied clare-obscure, and sought for an
enhancement of colour in it; they looked into the veil of night, and addressed
themselves to a painting of darkness such as could only have proceeded from
the <i>plein-air</i> school. For this darkness of theirs is likewise full of atmosphere,
a darkness in which there is life and breath and palpitation. In earlier days,
when a night was painted, everything was thick and opaque, covered with
black verging into yellow; to this latter error artists were seduced by the crusts
of varnish upon old pictures. Now they learnt to interpret the mysterious
life of the night, and to render the bluish-grey atmosphere of twilight. Or if
figures were to be painted in a room, artists rendered the circulation of the air
amid groups of people, which Correggio called &ldquo;the ambient&rdquo; and Velasquez
&ldquo;respiration.&rdquo; And there came also the study of artificial illumination&mdash;of
the delicate coloured charm of many-coloured lanterns, of the flaring gas
or lamp-light which streams through the glass windows of shops, flaring and
radiating through the night and reflected in a blazing glow upon the faces of
men and women. Under these purely pictorial points of view the gradual
widening of the range of subject was completed.</p>

<p>So long as the acquisition of sunlight was the point in question, representations
from the life of artisans in town and country stood at the centre itself of
artistic efforts, because the conception and technical methods of the new art
could be tested upon them with peculiar success. And through these pictures
painting came into closer sympathy with the heart-beat of the age. At an
epoch when the labouring man as such, and the political and social movement
in civilisation, had become matters of absorbing interest, the picture of artisans
necessarily claimed an important place in art; and one of the best sides of the
moral value of modern painting lies in its no longer holding itself in indifference
aloof from these themes. When the century began, Hector and Agamemnon
alone were qualified for artistic treatment, but in the natural course of development
the disinherited, the weary and heavy-laden likewise acquired rights of
citizenship. In the passage where Vasari speaks of the Madonnas of Cimabue,
comparing them with the older Byzantine Virgins, he says finely that the Florentine
master brought more &ldquo;goodness of heart&rdquo; into painting. And perhaps
the historians of the future will say the same about the art of the present.</p>

<p>The predilection for the disinherited was in the beginning to such an extent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span>
identified with the plain, straightforward painting of the proletariat that
Naturalism could not be conceived at all except in so far as it dealt with
poverty: in making its first great successes it had sought after the miserable
and the outcast, and serious critics recognised its chief importance in the
discovery of the fourth estate. Of course, the painting of paupers, as a sole
field of activity for the new art, would have been an exceedingly one-sided
acquisition.  It is not merely the working-man who should be painted, because
the age must strive to compass in a large and full spirit the purport of its own
complicated conditions of life. So there began, in general, the representation,
so long needed, of the man of to-day and of society agitated, as it is, by the
stream of existence. As Zola wrote in the very beginning of the movement:
&ldquo;Naturalism does not depend upon the choice of subject. The whole of
society is its domain, from the drawing-room to the drinking-booth. It is
only idiots who would make Naturalism the rhetoric of the gutter. We claim
for ourselves the whole world.&rdquo; Everything is to be painted,&mdash;forges, railway-stations,
machine-rooms, the workrooms of manual labourers, the glowing
ovens of smelting-works, official fêtes, drawing-rooms, scenes of domestic life,
<i>cafés</i>, storehouses and markets, the races and the Exchange, the clubs and the
watering-places, the expensive restaurants and the dismal eating-houses for the
people, the <i>cabinets particuliers</i> and <i>chic des premières</i>, the return from the
Bois and the promenades on the seashore, the banks and the gambling-halls,
casinos, boudoirs, studios, and sleeping-cars, overcoats, eyeglasses and red
dress-coats, balls, <i>soirées</i>, sport, Monte Carlo and Trouville, the lecture-rooms
of universities and the fascination of the crowded streets in the evening, the
whole of humanity in all classes of society and following every occupation, at
home and in the hospitals, at the theatre, upon the squares, in poverty-stricken
slums and upon the broad boulevards lit with electric light. Thus the new art
flung aside the blouse, and soon displayed itself in the most various costumes,
down to the frock-coat and the smoking-jacket. The rude and remorseless
traits which it had at first, and which found expression in numbers of peasant,
artisan, and hospital pictures, were subdued and softened until they even
became idyllic. Moreover, the scale of painting over life-size, favoured in the
early years of the movement, could be abandoned, since it arose essentially
from competition with the works of the historical school. So long as those
huge pictures covered the walls at exhibitions, artists who obeyed a new
tendency were forced from the beginning&mdash;if they wished to prevail&mdash;to
produce pictures of the same size. But since historical painting was finally
dead and buried, there was no need to set up such a standard any longer,
and a transition could be made to a smaller scale, better fitted for works of an
intimate character. The dazzling tones in which the Impressionists revelled
were replaced by those which were dim and soft, energy and force by subdued
and tender treatment, largeness of size by a scale which was small and intimate.</p>

<p>That was more or less the course of evolution run through in all European
countries in a similar way between the years 1875 and 1885. Just in the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>
way from this time onwards the Decorative-Stylists&rsquo; tendency set in universally.
Hitherto everything was focused on the &ldquo;picture as such.&rdquo; Tasteless
novelty or methodless imitation held sway over the applied arts. The endeavours
of the next decade aimed at freeing the picture from its isolation
and making the room itself a harmonious work of art. A long line of eminent
artists took in hand the hitherto neglected subject of art in decoration; and
as thereby new blood was infused into the applied arts, so on the other hand
pictorial art in one way renounced its freedom to fit itself into its new frame.
Colour, which formerly was determined principally by the lighting, now
became subordinate to a decorative scheme. Truth is no longer the end and
aim of art, but fitness, harmony of form and colour values. It is, however,
obviously impossible to give verse and chapter to the history of this development,
just as it would be impossible to fix a boundary line between the two
roads, the Impressionistic on the one hand and the Decorative on the other.
We will wander free from one country to another, and try to assign to each its
proper place in the general chart of modern painting.</p>

<p class="center chap2">FRANCE</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Paris,</span> which for a hundred years had given the signal for all novel
tactics in European art, still remained at the head of the movement;
the artistic temperament of the French people themselves, and the superlatively
excellent training which the painter enjoys in Paris, enable him at once to
follow every change of taste with confidence and ease. In 1883 Manet died,
on the varnishing day of the Salon, and in the preface which Zola wrote to
the catalogue of the exhibition held after the death of the master he was
well able to say: &ldquo;His influence is an accomplished fact, undeniable, and
making itself more deeply felt with every fresh Salon. Look back for twenty
years, recall those black Salons, in which even studies from the nude seemed
as dark as if they had been covered with mouldering dust. In huge frames
history and mythology were smothered in layers of bitumen; never was
there an excursion into the province of the real world, into life and into perfect
light; scarcely here or there a tiny landscape, where a patch of blue sky ventured
bashfully to shine down. But little by little the Salons were seen to
brighten, and the Romans and Greeks of mahogany to vanish in company
with the nymphs of porcelain, whilst the stream of modern representations
taken from ordinary life increased year by year, and flooded the walls, bathing
them with vivid tones in the fullest sunlight. It was not merely a new period;
it was a new painting bent upon reaching the perfect light, respecting the
law of colour values, setting every figure in full light and in its proper place,
instead of adapting it in an ideal fashion according to established tradition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the way had been paved for this change, when the new principles
had been transferred from the chamber of experiments to full publicity,
from the <i>Salon des Refusés</i> to the Salon which was official, it was chiefly
<i>Bastien-Lepage</i> who gained the first adherents to them amongst the public.
But because he does not belong to the pioneers of art, and merely adapted
for the great public elements that had been won by Manet, the immoderate
praise which was accorded him in earlier days has been recently brought
within more legitimate limits. It has been urged, by way of restriction,
that he stands in relation to Manet as Breton to Millet, and that, admitting
all differences, he has nevertheless a certain resemblance to his teacher,
Cabanel. As the latter rendered Classicism elegant, Bastien-Lepage, it has been
said, softened the ruggedness of Naturalism, cut and polished the nails of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span>
peasants, and made their rusticity
a pretty thing, qualifying it
for the drawing-room. Degas
was in the habit of calling him
the Bouguereau of Naturalism.
As a matter of fact, Naturalism
was bound to make certain concessions
if it were ever to prevail,
and such critics forget that it
was just these amiable concessions
which helped the principles
of Manet to prevail more swiftly
than would have been otherwise
possible. All the forms and
ideas of the Impressionists, with
which no one, outside the circle
of artists, had been able to
reconcile himself, were to be
found in Bastien-Lepage, purified,
mitigated, and set in a
golden style. He followed the
<i>eclaireurs</i>, as the leader of the
main body of the army which
has gained the decisive battle, and in this way he has fulfilled an important

<p>Bastien-Lepage was born in ancient Damvillers&mdash;once a small stronghold
of Lorraine&mdash;in a pleasant, roomy house that told a tale of even prosperity
rather than of wealth. As a boy he played amongst the venerable moats
which had been converted into orchards. Thus in his youth he received
the freshest impressions, being brought up in the heart of nature. His father
drew a good deal himself, and kept his son at work with the pencil, without
any æsthetic theories, without any vague ideal, and without ever uttering
the word &ldquo;academy&rdquo; or &ldquo;museum.&rdquo; Having left school in Verdun, Bastien-Lepage
went to Paris to become an official in the post-office. Of an afternoon,
however, he drew and painted with Cabanel. But he was Cabanel&rsquo;s pupil
much as Voltaire was a pupil of the Jesuits. &ldquo;My handicraft,&rdquo; as he said
afterwards, &ldquo;I learnt at the Academy, but not my art. You want to paint
what exists, and you are invited to represent the unknown ideal, and to dish
up the pictures of the old masters. In old days I scrawled drawings of gods
and goddesses, Greeks and Romans, beings I didn&rsquo;t know, and didn&rsquo;t understand,
and regarded with supreme indifference. To keep up my courage,
I repeated to myself that this was possibly &lsquo;grand art,&rsquo; and I ask myself
sometimes whether anything academical still remains in my composition.
I do not say that one should only paint everyday life; but I do assert that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span>
when one paints the past it should, at any rate, be made to look like something
human, and correspond with what one sees around one. It would
be so easy to teach the mere craft of painting at the academies, without incessantly
talking about Michael Angelo, and Raphael, and Murillo, and
Domenichino. Then one would go home afterwards to Brittany, Gascony,
Lorraine, or Normandy, and paint what lies around; and any morning, after
reading, if one had a fancy to represent the Prodigal Son, or Priam at the
feet of Achilles, or anything of the kind, one would paint such scenes in one&rsquo;s
own fashion, without reminiscences of the galleries&mdash;paint them in the surroundings
of the country, with the models that one has at hand, just as if
the old drama had taken place yesterday evening. It is only in that way
that art can be living and beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The outbreak of the war fortunately prevented him from remaining long
at the Academy. He entered a company of Franc-Tireurs, took part in the
defence of Paris, and returned ill to Damvillers. Here he came to know
himself and his peculiar talent. At once a poet and a realist, he looked at
nature with that simple
frankness which those alone
possess who have learnt
from youth upwards to see
with their own eyes instead
of trusting to other people&rsquo;s.
His friends called him
&ldquo;primitive,&rdquo; and there was
some truth in what they
said, for Bastien-Lepage
came to art free from all
trace of mannerism; he
knew nothing of academical
rules, and merely relied
upon his eyes, which were
always open and trustworthy.</p>

<p>Looking back as far as
he could, he was able to
remember nothing except
gleaners bowed over the
stubble-fields, vintagers
scattered amid the furrows
of the vineyards, mowers
whose robust figures rose
brightly from the green
meadows, shepherdesses
seeking shelter beneath tall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
trees from the blazing rays of the midday sun, shepherds shivering in their
ragged cloaks in winter, pedlars hurrying with great strides across the plain
raked by a storm, laundresses laughing as they stood at their tubs beneath
the blossoming apple-trees. He was impressionable to everything: the
dangerous-looking tramp who hung about one day near his father&rsquo;s house;
the wood-cutter groaning beneath the weight of his burden; the passer-by
trampling the fresh grass of the meadows and leaving his trace behind him;
the little sickly girl minding her lean cow upon a wretched field; the fire
which broke out in the night and set the whole village in commotion. That
was what he wanted to paint, and that is what he has painted. The life of the
peasants of Lorraine is the theme of all his pictures, the landscape of Lorraine
is their setting. He painted what he loved, and he loved what he painted.</p>

<p>It was in Damvillers that he felt at home as an artist. He had his studio in
the second storey of his father&rsquo;s house,
though he usually painted in the open
air, either in the field or the orchard,
whilst his grandfather, an old man of
eighty, was near him clipping the trees,
watering the flowers, and weeding the
grass. His mother, a genuine peasant,
was always busy with the thousand
cares of housekeeping. Of an evening
the whole family sat together round
the lamp, his mother sewing, his father
reading the paper, his grandfather with
the great cat on his lap, and Jules working.
It was at this time that he produced
those familiar domestic scenes,
thrown off with a few strokes, which
were to be seen at the exhibition of
the works which he left behind him.
He knew no greater pleasure than that
of drawing again and again the portraits
of his father and mother, the
old lamp, or the velvet cap of his
grandfather. At ten o&rsquo;clock sharp his
father gave the signal for going to bed.</p>

<p>In Paris, indeed, other demands
were made. In 1872 he painted, with
the object of being represented in the
Salon, that remarkable picture &ldquo;In
the Spring,&rdquo; the only one of his works
which is slightly hampered by conventionality
in conception. The pupil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span>
of Cabanel is making an effort
at truth, and has not yet
the courage to be true altogether.
Here, as in the
&ldquo;Spring Song&rdquo; which followed,
there is a mixture of
borrowed sentiment, work in
the old style and fresh Naturalism.
The landscape is
painted from nature, and the
peasant woman is real, but
the Cupids are taken from
the old masters.</p>

<p>The next years were devoted
to competitive labours.
To please his father and
mother Bastien-Lepage twice
contested the <i>Prix de Rome</i>.
In 1873 he painted as a prize
exercise a &ldquo;Priam before
Achilles,&rdquo; and in 1875 an
&ldquo;Annunciation of the Angel
to the Shepherds,&rdquo; that now
famous picture which received
the medal at the World Exhibition
of 1878. And he who afterwards revelled in the clearest <i>plein-air</i>
painting here celebrates the secret wonders of the night, though the
influences of Impressionism are here already visible. In his picture the
night is as dark as in Rembrandt&rsquo;s visions; yet the colours are not
harmonised in gold-brown, but in a cool grey silver tone. And how simple
the effect of the heavenly appearance upon the shepherds lying round the
fire of coals! The place of the curly ideal heads of the old sacred
painting has been taken by those of bristly, unwashed men who, nurtured
amid the wind and the weather, know nothing of those arts of toilette so
much in favour with the imitators of Raphael, and who receive the miracle
with the simplicity of elemental natures. Fear and abashed astonishment
at the angelic appearance are reflected in their faces, and the plain and homely
gestures of their hands are in correspondence with their inward excitement.
Even the angel turning towards the shepherds was conceived in an entirely
human and simple way. In spite of this, or just because of it, Bastien failed
with his &ldquo;Annunciation to the Shepherds,&rdquo; as he had done previously with
his &ldquo;Priam.&rdquo; Once the prize was taken by Léon Comerre, a pupil of Cabanel,
and on the other occasion by Josef Wencker, the pupil of Gérôme. It was
written in the stars that Bastien-Lepage was not to go to Rome, and it did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>
him as little harm as it had done to Watteau a hundred and sixty years before.
In Italy Bastien-Lepage would only have been spoilt for art. The model for
him was not one of the old Classic painters, but nature as she is in Damvillers,&mdash;Nature,
the great mother. When the works sent in for the competition
were exhibited a sensation was made when one day a branch of laurel was
laid on the frame of Bastien-Lepage&rsquo;s &ldquo;Annunciation to the Shepherds&rdquo;
by Sarah Bernhardt. And Sarah Bernhardt&rsquo;s portrait became the most
celebrated of the small likenesses which soon laid the foundation of the painter&rsquo;s
fame.</p>

<p>The portrait of his grandfather, that marvellous work of a young man
of five-and-twenty, is the first picture in which he was completely himself.
The old man sits in a corner of the garden, just as usual, in a brown cap, his
spectacles upon his nose, his arms crossed upon his lap, with a horn snuff-box
and a check handkerchief lying upon his knees. How perfectly easy and
natural is the pose, how thoughtful the physiognomy, what a personal note
there is in the dress! Nor are there in that garden, bathed in light, any of
those black shadows which only fall in the studio. Everything bore witness
to a simplicity and sincerity which justified the greatest hopes. After that
first work the world knew that Bastien-Lepage was a preeminent portrait
painter, and he did not betray the promise of his youth. His succeeding
pictures showed that he had
not merely rusticity and
nature to rely upon, but that
he was a <i>charmeur</i> in the best
sense of the word.</p>

<p>This ingenuous artist, who
knew nothing of the history
of painting, and felt more at
home in the open air than in
museums, was not ignorant,
at any rate, of the portraits
of the sixteenth century, and
had chosen for his likenesses
a scale as small as that which
Clouet and his school preferred.
The representation
here reaches a depth of characterisation
which recalls Jan
van Eyck&rsquo;s little pearls of
portrait painting. In these
works also he mostly confined
himself to bright lights. Portraits
of this type are those
of his brother, of Madame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>
Drouet, the aged friend of Victor Hugo, with her weary, gentle, benevolent
face&mdash;a masterpiece of intimate feeling and refinement; of his friend
and biographer André Theuriet, of Andrieux the prefect of the police, and,
above all, the famous and signal work of inexorable truth and marvellous
delicacy, Sarah Bernhardt in profile, with her tangled chestnut hair, sitting
upon a white fur, arrayed in a white China-silk dress with yellowish lights
in it, and carefully examining a Japanese bronze. The bizarre grace of the
tragic actress, her slender figure, fashioned, as it were, for Donatello, the
nervous intensity with which she sits there, her weird Chinese method of
wearing the hair, and the profile of which she is so proud, have been rendered
in none of her many likenesses with such an irresistible force of attraction
as in this little masterpiece. In some of his other portraits Bastien-Lepage
has not disdained the charm of obscure light; he has not done so, for example,
in the little portrait of Albert Wolff, the art-critic, as he sits at his writing-desk
amongst his artistic treasures, with a cigarette in his hand. Only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
Clouet and Holbein painted miniature portraits of such refinement. Amongst
moderns, probably Ingres alone has reached such a depth of characterisation
upon the smallest scale, and in general he is the most closely allied to Bastien-Lepage
as a portrait painter in profound study of physiognomy, and in the
broad and, one might say, chased technique of his little drawings. Comparison
with Gaillard would be greatly to the disadvantage of this great
engraver, for Bastien-Lepage is at once more seductive and many-sided. It
is curious how seldom his portraits have that family likeness which is elsewhere
to be found amongst almost all portrait painters. In his effort at
penetrative characterisation he alters, on every occasion, his entire method of
painting according to the personality, so that it leaves at one time an effect that
is bizarre, coquettish, and full of intellectual power and spirit, at another one
which is plain and large, at another one which is bashful, sparing, and <i>bourgeois</i>.</p>

<p>As a painter of peasant life he made his first appearance in 1878.</p>

<p>In the Salon of this year a sensation was made by a work of such truth
and poetry as had not been seen since Millet; this was the &ldquo;Hay Harvest.&rdquo;
It is noon. The June sun throws its sultry beams over the mown meadows.
The ground rises slowly to a boundless horizon, where a tree emerges here
and there, standing motionless against the brilliant sky. The grey and the
green of these great plains&mdash;it is as if the weariness of many toilsome miles
rose out of them&mdash;weighed heavily upon one, and created a sense of forsaken
loneliness. Only two beings, a pair of day-labourers, break the wide level
scorched by a quivering, continuous
blaze of light. They
have had their midday meal,
and their basket is lying near
them upon the ground. The
man has now lain down to
sleep upon a heap of hay,
with his hat tilted over his
eyes. But the woman sits
dreaming, tired with the long
hours of work, dazzled with
the glare of the sun, and overpowered
by the odour of the
hay and the sultriness of noon.
She does not know the drift
of her thoughts; nature is
working upon her, and she
has feelings which she scarcely
understands herself. She is
sunburnt and ugly, and her
head is square and heavy,
and yet there lies a world of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span>
sublime and mystical poetry in her dull, dreamy eyes gazing into a
mysterious horizon. By this picture and &ldquo;The Potato Harvest,&rdquo; which
succeeded it in 1879, Bastien-Lepage, the splendid, placed himself in the
first line of modern French painters. This time he renders the sentiment
of October. The sandy fields, impregnated with dust, rest in a white,
subdued light of noon; pale brown are the potato stalks, pale brown the
blades of grass, and the roads are bright with dust; and through this
landscape, with its wide horizon, where the tree-tops, half despoiled already,
shiver in the wind, there blows <i>le grand air</i>, a breeze strong as only Millet
in his water-colours had the secret of painting. With Millet he shares likewise
the breath of tender melancholy which broods so sadly over his pictures.
&ldquo;The Girl with the Cow,&rdquo; the little Fauvette, that child of social misery&mdash;misery
that lies sorrowful and despairing in the gaze of her eyes&mdash;is perhaps
the most touching example of his brooding devotion to truth. Her brown
dress is torn and dirty, while a grey kerchief borders her famished, sickly
face. A waste, disconsolate landscape, with a frozen tree and withered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>
thistles, stretches round like a boundless Nirvana. Above there is a whitish,
clear, tremulous sky, making everything paler, more arid and wearily bright;
there is no gleam of rich luxuriant tints, but only dry, stinted colours; and
not a sound is there in the air, not a scythe driving through the grass, not a
cart clattering over the road. There is something overwhelming in this
union between man and nature. One thinks of the famous words of Taine:
&ldquo;Man is as little to be divided from the earth as an animal or a plant.
Body and soul are influenced in the same way by the environment of nature,
and from this influence the destinies of men arise.&rdquo; As an insect draws its
entire nature, even its form and colour, from the plant on which it lives,
so is the child the natural product of the earth upon which it stands, and all
the impulses of its spirit are reflected in the landscape.</p>

<p>In 1879 Bastien-Lepage went a step further. In that year appeared
&ldquo;Joan of Arc,&rdquo; his masterpiece in point of spiritual expression. Here he
has realised the method of treating historical pictures which floated before
him as an idea at the Academy, and has, at the same time, solved a problem
which beset him from his youth&mdash;the penetration of mysticism and the world
of dreams into the reality of life. &ldquo;The Annunciation to the Shepherds,&rdquo;
&ldquo;In Spring,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Spring Song&rdquo; were merely stages on a course of
which he reached the destination in &ldquo;Joan of Arc.&rdquo; His ideal was &ldquo;to
paint historical themes without reminiscences of the galleries&mdash;paint them in
the surroundings of the country, with the models that one has at hand, just
as if the old drama had taken
place yesterday evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scene of the picture is
a garden of Damvillers painted
exactly from nature, with its
grey soil, its apple and pear-trees
clothed with small
leaves, its vegetable beds, and
its flowers growing wild. Joan
herself is a pious, careworn,
dreamy country girl. Every
Sunday she has been to
church, lost herself in long
mystic reveries before the old
sacred pictures, heard the
misery of France spoken of;
and the painted statues of the
parish church and its tutelary
saints pursue her thoughts.
And just to-day, as she sat
winding yarn in the shadow of
the apple-trees, murmuring a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>
prayer, she heard of a sudden the heavenly voices speaking. The spirits of
St. Michael, St. Margaret, and St. Catharine, before whose statues she has
prayed so often, have freed themselves from the wooden images and float as
light phantoms, as pallid shapes of mist, which will as suddenly vanish into air
before the eyes of the dreaming girl. Joan rises trembling, throwing her stool
over, and steps forward. She stands in motionless ecstasy stretching out her left
arm, and gazing into vacancy with her pupils morbidly dilated. Of all human
phases of expression which painting can approach, such mystical delirium is
perhaps the hardest to render; and probably it was only by the aid of
hypnotism, to which the attention of the painter was directed just then by the
experiments of Charcot, that Bastien-Lepage was enabled to produce in his
model that look of religious rapture, oblivious to the whole world, which is
expressed in the vague glance of her eyes, blue as the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joan of Arc&rdquo; was succeeded by &ldquo;The Beggar,&rdquo; that life-size figure of the
haggard old tramp who, with a thick stick under his arm&mdash;of which he would
make use upon any suitable occasion&mdash;picks up what he can in the villages, saying
a paternoster before the doors while he begs. This time he has been
ringing at the porch of an ordinary middle-class dwelling, and he is sulkily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span>
thrusting into the wallet slung round his shoulders a great hunch of bread
which a little girl has just given to him. There is a mixture of spite and
contempt in his eyes as he shuffles off in his heavy wooden shoes. And behind
the doorpost the little girl, who, in her pretty blue frock, has such a trim air
of wearing her Sunday best, looks rather alarmed and glances timidly at the
mysterious old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Un brave Homme,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Le Père Jacques,&rdquo; as the master afterwards
called the picture, was to some extent a pendant to &ldquo;The Beggar.&rdquo; He
comes out of the wood wheezing, with a pointed cap upon his head and a
heavy bundle of wood upon his shoulders, whilst at his side his little grandchild
is plucking the last flowers. It is November; the leaves have turned
yellow and cover the ground. Père Jacques is providing against the Winter.
And the Winter is drawing near&mdash;death.</p>

<p>Bastien-Lepage&rsquo;s health had never been good, nor was Parisian life calculated
to make it better. Slender and delicate, blond with blue eyes and a
sharply chiselled profile&mdash;<i>tout petit, tout blond, les cheveux à la bretonne, le nez
retroussé et une barbe d&rsquo;adolescent</i>, as Marie Baskirtscheff describes him&mdash;he was
just the type which <i>Parisiennes</i>
adore. His studio
was besieged; there was no
entertainment to which he
was not invited, no committee,
no meeting to hold
judgment over pictures at
which he was not present.
Amateurs fought for his
works and asked for his
advice when they made purchases.
Pupils flocked to
him in numbers. He was
intoxicated with the Parisian
world, enchanted with its
modern elegance; he loved
the vibration of life, and rejoiced
in masked balls like a
child. Consumptive people
are invariably sensuous,
drinking in the pleasures of
life with more swift and
hasty draughts. He then
left Paris and plunged into
the whirlpool of other great
cities. From Switzerland,
Venice, and London he came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span>
back with pictures and landscapes. In London, indeed, he painted that
beautiful picture &ldquo;The Flower-Girl,&rdquo; the pale, delicate child upon whose
faded countenance the tragedy of life has so early left its traces. Through
the whole summer of 1882 he worked incessantly in Damvillers. Once more
he painted his native place in a landscape of the utmost refinement. Here,
as in his portraits, everything has been rendered with a positive trenchancy,
with a severe, scientific effort after truth, in which there lies what is
almost a touch of aridness. And yet an indescribable magic is thrown
over the fragrant green of the meadows, the young, quivering trees, and the
still pond which lies rippling in the cloudless summer day.</p>

<p>Enthusiastically adored by the women in his school of painting, he had
found a dear friend in <i>Marie Baskirtscheff</i>, the distinguished young Russian
girl who had become his pupil just as his fame began to rise. It is charming
to see the enthusiasm with which Marie speaks of him in her diary. &ldquo;<i>Je peins
sur la propre palette du vrai Bastien, avec des couleurs à lui, son pinceau, son
atelier, et son frère pour modèle.</i>&rdquo; And how the others envy her because of it!
&ldquo;<i>La petite Suédoise voulait toucher à sa palette.</i>&rdquo; With Marie he sketched his
plans for the future, and in the midst of this restless activity he was summoned
hence together with her, for she also died young, at the age of twenty-four,
just as her pictures began to create a sensation. A touching idyll in her diary
tells how the girl learnt, when she was dying of consumption, that young
Bastien had also fallen ill, and been given up as hopeless. So long as Marie
could go out of doors she went with her mother and her aunt to visit her sick
friend; and when she was no longer allowed to leave the house he had himself
carried up the steps to her drawing-room by his brother, and there they both
sat beside each other in armchairs, and saw the end draw near, merciless and
inevitable, the end of their young lives, their talents, their ambition, and their
hopes. &ldquo;At last! Here it is then, the end of all my sufferings! So many
efforts, so many wishes, so many plans, so many &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, and then to die
at four-and-twenty upon the threshold of them all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her last picture was one of six
schoolboys, sons of the people, who
are standing at a street corner chattering;
and it makes a curiously virile
impression, when one considers that
it was painted by a blond young girl,
who slept under dull blue silken bed-curtains,
dressed almost entirely in
white, was rubbed with perfumes after
a walk in hard weather, and wore on
her shoulders furs which cost two
thousand francs. It hangs in the
Luxembourg, and for a long time a
lady dressed in mourning used to
come there every week and cry before
the picture painted by the daughter
whom she had lost so early. Marie
died on 31st October 1884, and
Bastien barely a month afterwards.
&ldquo;The Funeral of a Young Girl,&rdquo; in
which he wished to immortalise the
funeral of Marie, was his last sketch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span>
his farewell to the world, to the living, alluring, ever splendid nature which
he loved so much, grasped and comprehended so intimately, and to the
hopes which built up their deceptive castles in the air before his dying gaze.
He died before he reached Raphael&rsquo;s age, for he was barely thirty-six. The
final collapse came on 10th December 1884, upon a sad, rainy evening,
after he had lain several months upon a bed of sickness. His frame was
emaciated, and as light as that of a child; his face was shrivelled&mdash;the eyes
alone had their old brilliancy.</p>

<p>On 14th December his body was brought up to the Eastern railway
station. The coffin was covered with roses, white elder blossoms, and
immortelles. And now he lies buried in Lorraine, in the little churchyard
of Damvillers, where his father and grandfather rest beneath an old apple-tree.
Red apple-blossoms he too loved so dearly. His importance Marie
Baskirtscheff has summarised simply and gracefully in the words: &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est

sont que des fabricants de n&rsquo;importe quoi à côté de lui.... On ne peut plus</i>

<p>This tender poetic trait which runs through his works is what principally
distinguishes him from <i>L&rsquo;hermitte</i>, the most sterling representative of the
picture of peasant life at the present time. L&rsquo;hermitte, also, like most
of these painters of peasants, was himself the son of a peasant. He
came from Mont-Saint-Père, near Château-Thierry, a quiet old town, where
from the great &ldquo;Hill of Calvary&rdquo; one sees a dilapidated Gothic church
and the moss-grown roofs of thatched houses. His grandfather was a
vine-grower and his father a schoolmaster. He worked in the field himself,
and, like Millet, he painted afterwards the things which he had done
himself in youth. His principal works were pictures of reapers in the
field, peasant women in church, young wives nursing their children, rustics
at work, here and there masterly water-colours, pastels and charcoal drawings,
in 1888 the pretty illustrations to André Theuriet&rsquo;s <i>Vie Rustique</i>, the
decoration of a hall at the Sorbonne with representations of rustic life, in
his later period occasionally pictures from other circles of life, such as
&ldquo;The Fish-market of St. Malo,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lecture in the Sorbonne,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Musical Soirée,&rdquo; and finally, as
a concession to the religious
tendency of recent years, a
&ldquo;Christ visiting the House of
a Peasant.&rdquo; He has his studio
in the Rue Vaquelin in Paris,
though he spends most of his
time in the village where he was
born, and where he now lives
quietly and simply with the
peasants. Most of his works,
which are to be ranked throughout
amongst the most robust
productions of modern Naturalism,
are painted in the great
glass studio which he built in
the garden of his father&rsquo;s house.
Whilst Bastien-Lepage, through
a certain softness of temperament,
was moved to paint the
weak rather than the strong, and
less often men in the prime
of life than patriarchs, women,
and children, L&rsquo;hermitte displays
the peasant in all his rusticity.
He knows the country and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>271</span>
labours of the field which make the hands horny and the face brown,
and he has rendered them in a strictly objective manner, in a great
sculptural style. Bastien-Lepage is inclined to refinement and poetic tenderness;
in L&rsquo;hermitte everything is clear, precise, and sober as pale, bright
daylight.</p>

<p><i>Alfred Roll</i> was born in Paris, and the artisan of the Parisian streets is the
chief hero of his pictures. Like Zola in his Rougon-Macquart series, he set
before himself the aim of depicting the social life of the present age in a great
sequence of pictures&mdash;the workmen&rsquo;s strike, war, and toil. His pictures
give one the impression that one is looking down from the window upon an
agitated scene in the street. And his broad, plebeian workmanship is in
keeping with his rough and democratic subjects. He made a beginning
in 1875 with the colossal picture of the &ldquo;Flood at Toulouse.&rdquo; The roofs
of little peasants&rsquo; houses rise out of the expanse of water. Upon one of them
a group of country people have taken refuge, and are awaiting a boat which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>
is coming from the distance. A young mother summons her last remnant
of strength to save her trembling child. Beside her an old woman is sitting,
sunk in the stupor of indifference, while in front a bull is swimming, bellowing
wildly in the water. The influence of Géricault&rsquo;s &ldquo;Raft of the Medusa&rdquo;
is indeed obvious; but how much more plainly and actually has the struggle
for existence been represented here, than by the great Romanticist still
hampered by Classicism. The devastating effect of the masses of water
in all their elemental force could not have been more impressively rendered
than has been done through this bull struggling for life with all its enormous
strength.</p>

<p>In technique this picture belongs to the painter&rsquo;s earlier phase. Even
in the colouring of the naked figures it has still the dirty heaviness of
the Bolognese. This bond which united him to the school of Courbet
was broken when&mdash;probably under the influence of Zola&rsquo;s <i>Germinal</i>&mdash;he
painted &ldquo;The Strike,&rdquo; in 1880. The stern reality which goes through
Zola&rsquo;s accounts of the life of pit-men is likewise to be found in these
ragged and starving figures, clotted with coal dust, assembling in savage
desperation before the manufactory walls, prepared for a rising. The
dull grey of a rainy November
morning spreads above. In 1887
he painted war, war in the new
age, in which one man is not
pitted against another, but great
masses of men, who kill without
seeing one another, are made to
man&oelig;uvre with scientific accuracy&mdash;war
in which the balloon,
distant signalling, and all the
discoveries of science are turned
to account. &ldquo;Work&rdquo; was the
last picture of the series. There
are men toiling in the hot, dusty
air of Paris with sandstones of
all sizes. Life-size, upon life-size
figures, the drops of sweat were
seen upon the apathetic faces, and
the patches upon the blouses and
breeches. Any one who only
reckons as art what is fine and
delicate will necessarily find these
pictures brutal; but whoever
delights in seeing art in close
connection with the age, as it
really is, cannot deny to Alfred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>273</span>
Roll&rsquo;s great epics of labour the value of artistic documents of the first
rank.</p>

<p>He devoted himself to the more delicate problems of light, especially in
certain idyllic summer scenes, in which he delighted in painting life-size bulls
and cows upon the meadow, and beside them a girl, sometimes intended as
a milkmaid and sometimes as a nymph. Of this type was the picture of
1888, A Woman returning from Milking, &ldquo;Manda Lamétrie, Fermière.&rdquo;
With a full pail she is going home across the sunny meadow. Around there
is a gentle play of light, a soft atmosphere transmitting faint reflections,
lightly resting upon all forms, and mildly shed around them. A yet more
subtle study of light in 1889 was named &ldquo;The Woman with a Bull.&rdquo; Pale
sunbeams are rippling through the fluttering leaves, causing a delicious play
of fine tones upon the nude body of the young woman and the shining hide
of the bull.</p>

<p>On a strip of ground in the suburbs of Paris, where the town has come
to an end and the country has not yet begun, <i>Raffaelli</i>, perhaps the most
spirited of the Naturalists, has taken up his abode. He has painted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span>
workman, the vagabond, the
restlessness of the man who
does not know where he is
going to eat and sleep; the
small householder, who has all
he wants; the ruined man,
overtaken by misfortune,
whose only remaining passion
is the brandy-bottle,&mdash;he has
painted them all amid the
melancholy landscape around
Paris, with its meagre region
still in embryo, and its great
straight roads losing themselves
disconsolately in the
horizon. Théophile Gautier
has written somewhere that
the geometricians are the
ruination of landscapes. If
he lived in these days he
would find, on the contrary,
that those monotonous roads
running straight as a die give
landscape a strange and melancholy
grandeur. One thinks
of the passage in Zola&rsquo;s <i>Germinal</i>,
where the two socialists, Étienne and Suwarin, walk in the evening silently
along the edge of a canal, which, with the perpendicular stems of trees at
its side, stretches for miles, as if measured with a pair of compasses, through
a monotonous flat landscape. Only a few low houses standing apart break
the straight line of the horizon; only here and there, in the distance, does
there emerge a human being, whose diminished figure is scarcely perceptible
above the ground. Raffaelli was the first to understand the virginal beauty
of these localities, the dumb complaining language of poverty-stricken regions
spreading languidly beneath a dreary sky. He is the painter of poor people
and of wide horizons, the poet and historian of humanity living in the neighbourhood
of great cities. There sits a house-owner, or the proprietor of a
shop, in front of his own door; there a pedlar, or a man delivering parcels,
hurries across the field; there a rag-picker&rsquo;s dog strays hungry about a lonely
farmyard. Sometimes the wide landscapes are relieved by the manufactories,
water and gas-works which feed the huge crater of Paris. At other times
the snow lies on the ground, the skeletons of trees stand along the high-road,
and a driver shouts to his team; the heavy cart-horses covered with worsted
cloths, shiver, and an impression of intense cold strikes through you to your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>275</span>
very bones. Indeed, Raffaelli&rsquo;s austerity was first subdued a little when he
came to make a lengthy residence in England. Then he acquired a preference
for the light-coloured atmosphere and the gracious verdure of nature
in England. He began to take pleasure in tender spring landscapes, in place
of rigid scenes of snow. The poor soil no longer seems so hard and inhospitable,
but becomes attractive beneath the soft, peaceful, bluish atmosphere.
Even the uncivilised beings, with famine in their eyes, who wandered about
in his earliest pictures, become milder and more resigned. The grandfather,
in his blouse and wooden shoes, leads his grandchild by the hand amid the
first shyly budding verdure. Old men sit quietly in the grounds of the alms-house,
with the sun shining upon them. People no longer stand in the mist
of November evenings with their teeth chattering from the frost, but breathe
with delight the soft air of bright spring mornings.</p>

<p>Raffaelli, for fifteen years the master of this narrowly circumscribed
region, has recorded his
impressions of it in an
entirely personal manner,
in a style which in one of
his <i>brochures</i> he has himself
designated &ldquo;caractérisme.&rdquo;
And by comparing
the costumed
models in the pictures of
the previous generation
with the figures of Raffaelli,
the happiness of
this phrase is at once
understood. In fact, Raffaelli
is a great master of
characterisation, and perhaps
nowhere more trenchant
than in the illustrations
which he drew
for the <i>Revue Illustrée</i>.
Spirited caricatures of
theatrical representations
alternate with the grotesque
figures of the Salvation
Army. Yet he
feels most in his element
when he dives into the
horrors of Paris by night.
The types which he has
created live; they meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span>
you at every step, wander about the
boulevards in the cafés and outside
the barriers, and they haunt you with
their looks of misery, vice, and menace.</p>

<p><i>Giuseppe de Nittis</i>, an Italian turned
a Parisian, a bold, searching, nervously
excitable spirit, was the first <i>gentilhomme</i>
of Impressionism, the first who
made a transition from the rugged
painting of the proletariat to coquettish
pictures from the fashionable
quarters of the city, and reconciled
even the wider public to the principles
of Impressionism by the delicate
flavouring of his works.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a cold November morning.
Cold it was certainly, but in compensation
the morning vapour was as
fine as snow turned into mist. Yonder
in the crowded, populous, sooty
quarters of the city, in Paris busy
with trade and industry, this early
vapour which settles in the broad
streets is not to be found; the hurry
of awakening life, and the confused
movement of country carts, omnibuses,
and heavy, rattling freight-waggons,
have scattered, divided, and dispersed
it too quickly. Every passer-by bears
it away on his shabby overcoat, on his threadbare comforter, or disperses it with
his baggy gloves. It dribbles down the shivering blouses and the waterproofs
of toiling poverty, it dissolves before the hot breath of the many who have
passed a sleepless or dissipated night, it is absorbed by the hungry, it penetrates
into shops which have just been opened, into gloomy backyards, and
it floats up the staircases, dripping on the walls and banisters, right up to
the frozen attics. And that is the reason why so little of it remains outside.
But in the spacious and stately quarter of Paris, upon the broad boulevards
planted with trees and the empty quays the mist lay undisturbed, section
over section, like an undulating mass of transparent wool in which one felt
isolated, hidden, almost imbedded in splendour, for the sun rising lazily on
the distant horizon already shed a mild purple glow, and in this light the
mist level with the tops of the houses shone like a piece of muslin spread
over scarlet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This opening passage in Daudet&rsquo;s <i>Le Nabab</i> most readily gives the mood
awakened by Giuseppe do Nittis&rsquo; Parisian landscapes. De Nittis was born
in 1846 at Barletta, near Naples, in poor circumstances. In 1868, when
he was two-and-twenty years of age, he came to Paris, where Gérôme and
Meissonier interested themselves in him. Intercourse with Manet led him
to his range of subject. He became the painter of Parisian street-life as it
is to be seen in the neighbourhood of the quays, the painter of mist, smoke,
and air. The Salons of 1875 and 1876 contained his first pictures, the &ldquo;Place
des Pyramides&rdquo; and the view of the Pont Royal, fine studies of mist with
a tremulous grey atmosphere, out of which graceful little figures raise their
faint, vanishing outlines. From that time he has stood at the centre of
artistic life in Paris. He observed everything, saw everything, painted
everything&mdash;a strip of the boulevards, the Place du Carrousel, the Bois de
Boulogne, the races, the Champs Elysées, in the daytime with the budding
chestnuts, the flower-beds blooming in all colours, the playing fountains, the
women of grace and beauty, and the light carriages which crowd between
the Arc de Triomphe, the Obelisk, and the Gardens of the Tuileries, and in
the evening when chains of white and coloured lights flash among the dark
trees. De Nittis has interpreted all atmospheric phases. He seized the
intangible, the vibration of vapour, the dust of summer, and the rains of
December days. He breathed the atmosphere, as it were, with his eyes,
and felt with accuracy its greater or its diminished density. The great public
he gained by his exquisite sense of feminine elegance. Of marvellous charm
are the figures which give animation to the Place des Pyramides, the Place
du Carrousel, the Quai du Pont Neuf&mdash;women in the most coquettish toilettes,
men chatting together as they lean against a newspaper kiosk, flower-girls
offering bouquets, loiterers carelessly turning over the books exposed for
sale upon a stall, <i>bonnes</i> with short petticoats and broad ribbons, smart-looking
boys with hoops, and little girls with the air of great ladies. Since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span>
Gabriel de Saint Aubin, Paris has had no more faithful observer. &ldquo;De
Nittis,&rdquo; said Claretie in 1876, &ldquo;paints modern French life for us as that
brilliant Italian, the Abbé Galliani, spoke the French language&mdash;that is to
say, better than we do it ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The summit of his ability was reached in his last pictures from England.
One knows the London fogs of November, which hover over the town as black
as night, so that the gas has to be lit at noon, fogs which are suffocating and
shroud the nearest houses in a veil of crape. Scenes like this were made
for de Nittis&rsquo; brush. He roamed about in the smoke of the city, observed
the fashion of the season, the confusion of cabs and drays upon London
Bridge, the surge and hurry of the human stream in Cannon Street, the vast
panorama of the port of London veiled with smoke and fog, the fashionable
West End with its magnificent clubs, the green, quiet squares and great,
plainly built mansions; he studied the dense smoky atmosphere of fog compressed
into floating phantom shapes, the remarkable effects of light seen
when a fresh breeze suddenly drives the black clouds away. And again
his eye adapted itself at once to the novel environment. It was not merely
the blithe splendour of Paris that found an incomparable painter in Giuseppe
de Nittis, but London also with its thick atmosphere and that mixture of
damp, tawny fog and grey smoke. Piccadilly, the National Gallery, the
railway bridge at Charing Cross, the Green Park, the Bank, and Trafalgar
Square are varied samples of
these English studies, which
showed British painters themselves
that not one of them
had understood the foggy
atmosphere of London as
this tourist who was merely
travelling through the town.
&ldquo;Westminster&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cannon
Street,&rdquo; a pair of dreary,
sombre symphonies in ash-grey,
perhaps display the
highest of what De Nittis has
achieved in the painting of
air.</p>

<p>Born in Hamburg, though
a naturalised Frenchman,
<i>Ferdinand Heilbuth</i> took up
again the <i>cult</i> of the <i>Parisienne</i>
in the wake of Stevens,
and as he turned the acquisitions
of Impressionism to account
in an exceedingly pleasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span>
manner he seems, in comparison with Stevens, lighter and more vaporous
and gracious. He painted water-scenes, scenes on the greensward or in the
entrance squares of châteaux, placing in these landscapes girls in fashionable
summer toilette. He was particularly fond of representing them in a white
hat, a white or pearl-grey dress with a black belt and long black gloves, in
front of a bright grey stream, seated upon a fallen trunk, with a parasol
resting against it. The bloom of the atmosphere is harmonised in the very
finest chords with the virginal white of their dresses and the fresh verdure
of the landscapes. His pictures are little Watteaus of the nineteenth century,
as discreet in effect as they are piquant.</p>

<p>After Heilbuth&rsquo;s death <i>Albert Aublet</i>, who in earlier days depicted sanguinary
historical pieces, became the popular painter of girls, whose beauties
are gracefully interpreted in his pictures. When he paints the composer
Massenet, sitting at the piano surrounded by flowers and beautiful women,&mdash;when
he represents the doings of the fashionable world on the shore at a
popular watering-place, or young ladies plucking roses, or wandering meditatively
in bright dresses amid green shrubs and yellow flowers, or going
into the sea in white bathing-gowns, there may be nothing profound or particularly
artistic in it all, but it is none the less charming, attractive, bright,
joyous, and fresh.</p>

<p><i>Jean Béraud</i>, another interpreter of Parisian elegance, has found material
for numerous pictures in the blaze of the theatres, the naked shoulders of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>
ballet-girls, the dress-coats of
old gentlemen, the evening
humour of the boulevards, the
mysteries of the Café Anglais,
the bustle of Monte Carlo,
and the footlights of the Café-Concert.
But absolute painter
he is not. One would prefer
to have a less oily heaviness
in his works, a bolder and
freer execution more in keeping
with the lightness of the
subject, and for this one would
willingly surrender the touches
of <i>genre</i> which Béraud cannot
let alone even in these days.
But his illustrations are exceedingly
spirited.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to
classify painters according to
further specialties. In fact,
it is as little possible to bring
individuals into categories as
it was at the time of the
Renaissance, when the painter busied himself at the same time with sculpture,
architecture, and the artistic crafts. Great artists do not wall themselves
up in a narrow space to be studied. Liberated from the studio
and restored to nature, they endeavour, as in the best periods of art, to
encompass life as widely as possible. A mere enumeration, such as chance
offers, and such as will preserve a sense for the individuality of every man&rsquo;s
talent without attempting comparisons, seems therefore a better method to
pursue than a systematic grouping which could only be attained artificially
and by ambiguities.</p>

<p>The late <i>Ulysse Butin</i> settled down on the shore of the Channel and painted
the life of the fishermen of Villerville, a little spot upon the coast near Honfleur.
Sturdy, large-boned fellows drag their nets across the strand, carry
heavy anchors ashore, or lie smoking upon the dunes. The rays of the evening
sun play upon their clothes; the night falls, and a profound silence rests
upon the landscape.</p>

<p>By preference <i>Édouard Dantan</i> has painted the interiors of sculptors&rsquo;
studios&mdash;men turning pots, casting plaster, or working on marble, with grey
blouses, contrasting delicately with the light grey walls of workrooms which
are themselves flooded with bright and tender light. Very charming was
&ldquo;A Plaster Cast from Nature,&rdquo; painted in 1887: in the centre was a nude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>281</span>
female figure most naturally posed, whilst a fine, even atmosphere,
which lay softly upon the girl&rsquo;s form, streaming gently over it, was shed
around.</p>

<p>Having cultivated in the beginning the province of feminine nudity with
little success, in such pictures as &ldquo;The Bacchante&rdquo; of the Luxembourg,
&ldquo;The Woman with the Mask,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rolla,&rdquo; <i>Henri Gervex</i>, the spoilt child
of contemporary French painting, turned to the lecture-rooms of the
universities, and by his picture of Dr. Péan at La Salpétrière gave the
impulse to the many hospital pictures, surgical operations, and so forth
which have since inundated the Salon. With the upper part of her body
laid bare and her lips half opened, the patient lies under the influence
of narcotics, whilst Péan&rsquo;s assistant is counting her pulse. His audience
have gathered round. The light falls clear and peacefully into the room.
Everything is rendered simply, without diffidence, and with confidence and
quietude.</p>

<p><i>Duez</i>, when he had had his first success in 1879 with a large religious
picture&mdash;the triptych of Saint Cuthbert in the Luxembourg&mdash;appeared
with animal pictures, landscapes, portraits, or fashionable representations
of life in the streets and cafés. In the hands of such mild and complacent
spirits as <i>Friant</i> and <i>Goeneutte</i>, Naturalism fell into a mincing, lachrymose
condition; but in a series
of quiet, unpretentious pictures
<i>Dagnan-Bouveret</i> was more successful
in meeting the growing
inclination of recent years for
contemplative repose, just as in
the province of literature Ohnet,
Malot, and Claretie, with their
spirit of compromise, came after
those stern naturalists Flaubert
and Zola. According to the
drawing of Paul Renouard, Dagnan-Bouveret
is a little, black-haired
man with a dark complexion
and deep-set eyes, a short
blunt nose, and a black pointed
beard. There is nothing in him
which betrays spirit, caprice, and
audacity, but everything which
is an indication of patience and
endurance; and, as a matter of
fact, such are the qualities by
which he has gained his high
position. He is a man of poetic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>
talent, though rather tame, and stands to Bastien-Lepage and Roll as
Breton to Millet. One often fancies that it is possible to observe in
him that German <i>Gemüth</i>, that genial temper, for the satisfaction of which
Frau Marlitt provided in fiction. A pupil of Gérôme, he made his first
great success in the Salon of 1879 with the picture &ldquo;A Wedding at the
Photographer&rsquo;s.&rdquo; This was succeeded in 1882 by &ldquo;The Nuptial Benediction&rdquo;;
in 1883 by &ldquo;The Vaccination&rdquo;; in 1884 by &ldquo;The Horse-pond&rdquo;
of the Musée Luxembourg; in 1885 by a &ldquo;Blessed Virgin,&rdquo; a homely,
thoughtful, and delicately coloured picture which gained him many
admirers in Germany; and in 1886 by &ldquo;The Consecrated Bread,&rdquo; in
which he was one of the first to take up the study of light in interiors.
In a Catholic church there are sitting devout women&mdash;most of them old,
but also one who is young&mdash;and children, while an acolyte is handing them
consecrated bread. This simple scene in the damp village church, filled
with a tender gloom, is rendered with a winning homely plainness, and
with that touch of compassionate sentimentality which is the peculiar note
of Dagnan-Bouveret. The
&ldquo;Bretonnes au Pardon&rdquo; of
1889 thoroughly displayed
this definitive Dagnan: a
soft, peaceful picture, full
of simple and cordial poetry.
In the grass behind the
church, the plain spire of
which rises at the end of
a wall, women are sitting,
both young and old, in black
dresses and white caps. One
of them is reading a prayer
from a devotional book.
The rest are listening. Two
men stand at the side.
Everything is at peace; the
scheme of colour is soft and
quiet, while in the execution
there is something recalling
Holbein, and the effect is
idyllically moving like the
chime of a village bell when
the sun is going down.</p>

<p>The zeal with which
painters took up the study of
contemporary life, so long
neglected, did not, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span>
prevent the quality of French landscape painting from being exceedingly
high. New parts of the world were no longer to be conquered. For
fifteen years none of the nobler, nor of the less noble, landscapes of
France had been neglected, nor any strip of field; there were no flowers
that were not plucked, whether they were cultivated in forcing-houses
or had sprung pallid in a dark garden of old Paris. It was only the joy
in brightness and the newly discovered beauty of sunshine that brought
with them any change of material. Following the Impressionists, the landscape
painters deserted their forests. Those &ldquo;woodland depths,&rdquo; such as
Diaz and Rousseau painted, seldom appear in the works of the most modern
artists. In the severest opposition to such once popular scenes there lies the
plain, the wide expanse stretching forth like a carpet in bright, shining tones
under the play of tremulous sunbeams, and scarcely do a few trees break the
quiet line of the distant horizon. At first the poorest and most humble
corners were preferred. The painting of the poor brought even the most forlorn
regions into fashion. Later, in landscape also, a bent towards the most tender
lyricism corresponded with that inclination to idyllic sentiment which was
on the increase in figure painting. These painters have a peculiar joy in the
fresh mood of morning, when a light vapour hovers over the meadows and
the waters, before it is dissolved into shining dew. They love the bloom of
fruit-trees and the first smile of spring, or revel in the gradations of the dusk,
rich as they are in shades of tint, mistily wan and grey, pale lilac, delicate
green, and milky blue. The perspective is broad and fine; objects are entirely
absorbed by the harmony of colour, and the older and coarser treatment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span>
free light heightened to the most refined play by the most delicate shades
of hue. And these colourists deriving from Corot, with their soft grey
enveloping all, are opposed by others who strike novel and higher chords
upon the keyboard of Manet&mdash;landscape painters whom such simple and
intimate things do not satisfy, but who search after unexpected, fleeting,
and extraordinary impressions, analysing fantastically combined effects
of light.</p>

<p>A group of New-Impressionists, who might be called prismatic painters,
stand in this respect at the extreme left. Starting from the conviction that
the traditional mixing of colours upon the palette results after all only in
palette tones, and can never fully express the intensity and pulsating vividness
of tone-values, they founded the theory of the resolution of tones,&mdash;in other
words, they break up all compound colours into their primary hues, set these
directly upon the canvas, and leave it to the eye of the spectator to undertake
the mixture for itself. In particular <i>George Seurat</i> was an energetic disseminator
of this painting in points which excited new discussions amongst
artists and new polemics in the newspapers. His pictures were entirely composed
of flaming, glowing, and
shining patches. Close to these
pictures nothing was to be
seen but a confusion of
blotches, but at the proper
distance they took shape as
wild sea-studies in the brilliant
hues of noon, with rocks and
stones standing out in relief,
orgies of blue, red, and violet.
Such was Seurat&rsquo;s manner of
seeing nature. That such a
course brings with it a good
deal of monotony, that it
will hardly ever be possible
to quicken art to this extent
with science, is incontestable.
But it is just as certain that
Seurat was a painter of distinction
who shows in many
of his pictures a fine sense
for delicate, pale atmosphere.
Many of his landscapes, which
at close quarters look like
mosaics of small, smooth, variously
coloured stones, acquire
a vibrating light, such as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span>
Monet himself did not attain, when looked at from a proper distance.
<i>Signac</i>, <i>Anquetin</i>, <i>Angrand</i>, <i>Lucien Pissarro</i>, <i>Coss</i>, <i>Luèc</i>, <i>Rysselberghe</i>, and
<i>Valtat</i> are the names of the other representatives of this scientific painting,
and their method has not seldom enabled them to give expression in an overpowering
manner to the quiet of water and sky, the green of the meadows,
and the softness of tender light shifting over the sea.</p>

<p>When these &ldquo;spotted&rdquo; pictures hang in a room where they are fewer in
number than ordinary paintings they are difficult to understand. Only the
disadvantages of such a method of painting are noticed; the disagreeable
spottiness of the little points of colour ranged unpleasantly side by side, and
putting one in mind of a piece of embroidery work, does not exactly appeal
to the artist who looks for beautiful lines and <i>belle pâte</i> in a picture. Nevertheless,
the method would scarcely have found so many exponents did it not
afford an opportunity to get certain effects which are scarcely obtainable in
any other way. As a matter of fact, one finds in these pictures a sense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>
life, such shimmering, glimmering effects, such tremulous, vibrating light,
as could not be arrived at without this disintegration of colour into separate
points. Moreover, they have at a distance a decorative effect that leaves
other pictures far behind.</p>

<p>The importance of Neo-Impressionism, therefore, depends on two particulars.
First, in the analysis of light it has carried the principles of Impressionism
to their furthest limit; secondly, in the matter of decorative effect
it has laid aside one great fault of Impressionism, and has given us pictures
which, seen from a distance, take on a definite form instead of a blur of indistinct
tones.</p>

<p>Amongst the younger painters exhibiting in the Salon, <i>Pointelin</i>&mdash;without
any trace of imitation&mdash;perhaps comes nearest to the tender poetry of Corot,
and has with most subtlety interpreted the delicate charm of cold moods of
morning, the deep feeling of still solitude in a wide expanse. <i>Jan Monchablon</i>
views the meadow and the grass, the blades and variegated flowers of
the field, with the eyes of a primitive artist. Wide stretches of rolling ground
upon radiant spring days are usually to be seen in his pictures. The sun
shines, the grass sparkles, and the horizon spreads boundless around. In the
background cows are grazing, or there move small figures bathed in air, whilst
a dreamy rivulet murmurs in the foreground. The bright, soft light of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span>
Provence is the delight of <i>Montenard</i>, and he depicts with delicacy this landscape
with its bright, rosy hills, its azure sky, and its pale underwood. Light,
as he sees it, has neither motes nor shadows; its vibration is so intense and
fine that it fills the air with liquid gold, and absorbs the tints of objects,
wrapping them in a soft and mystic golden veil.</p>

<p><i>Dauphin</i>, who is nearly allied with him, always remains a colourist. His
painting is more animated, provocative, and blooming, especially in those
sea-pieces with their bright harbours, glittering waves, and rocking ships with
their sails shimmering and coquetting in the sunshine. The name of <i>Rosset-Granget</i>
recalls festal evenings, houses all aglow with lights and fireworks, or
red lanterns shedding forth their gleam into the dark blue firmament, and
reflected with a thousand fine tints in the sea.</p>

<p>The melancholy art of <i>Émile Barau</i>, a thoroughly rustic painter, who
renders picturesque corners of little villages with an extremely personal
accent, stands in contrast with the blithe painting of the devotees of light;
it is not the splendour of colour that attracts him, but the dun hues of dying
nature. He has come to a halt immediately in front of Paris, in the square
before the church of Creile. He knows the loneliness of village streets when
the people are at work in the fields, and the houses give a feeling that their
inhabitants are not far off and may return at any moment. His pictures
are harmonies in grey. The leading elements in his works are the pale light
lying upon colourless autumn sward, the mournful outlines of leafless trees
stretching their naked boughs into the air as though complaining, small still
ponds where ducks are paddling, the scanty green of meagre gardens, the
muddy waters of old canals, reddish-grey
roofs and narrow little streets
amid moss-covered hills, tall poplars
and willows by the side of swampy
ditches, and in the background the
old village steeple, which is scarcely
ever absent. <i>Damoye</i>, likewise, is fond
of twilight, and autumn and winter
evenings. He is the poet of the
great plains and dunes and the
sombre heaven, where isolated sunbeams
break shyly from behind
white clouds. A fine sea-painter,
<i>Boudin</i>, studies in Etretat, Trouville,
Saint Valery, Crotoy, and
Berck the dunes and the misty sky,
spreading in cold northern grey across
the silent sea. <i>Dumoulin</i> paints night
landscapes with deep blue shadows
and bright blue lights, while <i>Albert</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>288</span>
<i>Lebourg</i> has a passion for the grey of rain and the glittering snow which
gleams in the light, blue in one place, violet and rosy in another. <i>Victor
Binet</i> and <i>Réné Billotte</i> have devoted themselves to the study of that poor
region, still in embryo, which lies around Paris, a region where a delicate
observer finds so much that is pictorial and so much hidden poetry. Binet
is so delicate that everything grows nobler beneath his brush. He specially
loves to paint the poetry of twilight, which softens forms and tinges the trees
with a greyish-green, the quiet, monotonous plains where tiny footpaths lose
themselves in mysterious horizons, the expiring light of the autumn sun playing
with the fallen yellow leaves upon dusty highways. Réné Billotte&rsquo;s life is
exceedingly many-sided. In the forenoon he is an important ministerial
official, in the evening the polished man of society in dress-clothes and white
tie whom Carolus Duran painted. Of an afternoon, in the hours of dusk and
moonrise, he roams as a landscape painter in the suburbs of Paris; he is an
exceedingly accomplished man of the world, who only speaks in a low tone,
and what he specially loves in nature, too, is the hour when moonlight lies
gently and delicately over all forms. The scenes he usually chooses are a
quarry with light mist settling over it, a light-coloured cornfield in a bluish
dusk, a meadow bathed in pale light, or a strip of the seashore where the
delicate air is impregnated with moisture.</p>

<p>To be at once refined and true is the goal which portrait painting in recent
years has also specially set itself to reach. In the years of <i>chic</i> it started
with the endeavour to win from every personality its beauties, to paint men
and women &ldquo;to advantage&rdquo;; but
later, when the Naturalism of
Bastien-Lepage stood at its zenith,
it strove at all costs to seize the
actual human being, to catch, as
it were, the work-a-day character
of the personality as it is in involuntary
moments when people
believe themselves to be unobserved
and give up posing. The place
of those pompous arrangements of
the painters of material was taken
by a soul, and temperament interpreted
by an intelligence. And
corresponding with the universal
principle of conceiving man and
nature as an indivisible whole, it
became imperative in portrait
painting no longer to place persons
before an arbitrary background,
but in their real surroundings&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span>
paint the man of science in his laboratory, the painter in his studio,
the author at his work-table&mdash;and to observe with accuracy the atmospheric
influences of this environment.</p>

<p>The ready master-worker of this plain and sincere naturalism in portrait
painting was peculiarly <i>Fantin-Latour</i>, who ought not merely to be judged
by his latest paintings, which have something petrified, rigid, gloomy, and
professorial. In his younger days he was a solid and powerful artist, one
of the soundest and simplest of whom France could boast. His pictures
were dark in tone and harmonious, and had a puritanic charm. The portrait
of Manet, and that of the engraver Edwin Edwards and his wife, in particular,
will always preserve their historical value.</p>

<p>Later, when the whole bias of art tended away from the poorer classes,
and once more approached this fashionable world, portrait painting also
showed a tendency to become exquisite and over-refined, and to exhibit a
preference for symphonic arrangements of colour and subtilised effects of
light. White, light yellow, and light blue silks were harmonised upon very
delicate scales with pearly-grey backgrounds. Ladies in mantles of light
grey fur and rosy dresses stand amid dark-green shrubs, in which rose-coloured
lanterns are burning, or they sit in a ball-dress near a lamp which produces
manifold and tender transformations of light upon the white of the silk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span></p>

<p>The work of <i>Jacques Émile
Blanche</i>, the son of the
celebrated mad-doctor, is
peculiarly characteristic of
these tendencies of French
portrait painting. It is well
known that English fashion
was at this time regarded
in Paris as the height of elegance,
while Anglicisms were
entering more and more into
the French language; and
this tendency of taste gave
Blanche the occasion for
most æsthetic pictures. The
English Miss, in her attractive
mixture of affectation
and naïveté, in all her slim
and long-footed grace, has
found a delicate interpreter
in him. Tall ladies clad in
white, bitten with the Anglomania,
drink tea most æsthetically,
and sit there bored,
or are grouped round the piano; <i>gommeux</i>, neat, straight, <i>chic</i>, from their
tall hats to their patent-leather boots, look wearily about the world, with
an eyeglass fixed, a yellow rose in their buttonhole, and a thick stick in the
gloved hand. Amongst his portraits of well-known personalities, much notice
was attracted by that of his father in 1890&mdash;a modern Bertin the Elder,
and in 1891 by that of Maurice Barrès, a portrait in which he has analysed
the author of <i>Le Jardin de Bérénice</i> in a very simple and convincing fashion.</p>

<p>The brilliant Italian <i>Boldini</i> brought to this English <i>chic</i> the manual
volubility of a Southerner: sometimes he was microscopic <i>à la</i> Meissonier,
sometimes a juggler of the brush <i>à la</i> Fortuny, and sometimes he gave the
most seductive mannerism and the most diverting elegance to his portraits
of ladies. Born in 1845, the son of a painter of saints, Boldini had begun as
a Romanticist with pictures for Scott&rsquo;s <i>Ivanhoe</i>. From Ferrara he went to
Florence, where he remained six years. At the end of the sixties he emerged
in London, and, after he had painted Lady Holland and the Duchess of Westminster
there, he soon became a popular portrait painter. But since 1872
his home has been Paris, where the fine Anglo-Saxon aroma, the &ldquo;æsthetic&rdquo;
originality of his pictures, soon became an object of universal admiration.
In his portraits of women Boldini always renders what is most novel. It
is as if he knew in advance the new fashion which the coming season would
bring. His trenchantly cut figures of ladies in white dresses and with black
gloves have a defiant and insolent effect, and yet one which is captivating
through their ultra-modern <i>chic</i>. The portraits of Carolus Duran have
nothing of that charm which makes such an appeal to the nerves, nothing
of that discomposing indefinable quality which lies in the expression and
gestures of a fashionable woman, whose eccentricity reveals every day fresh
<i>nuances</i> of beauty. He had not the faculty of seizing movement, the most
difficult element in the world. But Boldini&rsquo;s pictures seem like bold and
sudden sketches which clinch the conception with spirit and swiftness in
liberal, pointed crayon strokes controlled by keen observation. There is
no ornament, no bracelet, no pillars and drapery. One hears the silken
bodice rustle over the tightly laced corset, sees the mobile foot, and the long
train swept to the side with a bold movement. Sometimes his creations are
full and luxuriant, nude even in their clothes, excited and full of movement;
sometimes they are bodiless, as if compact of the air, pallid and half-dead
with the strain of nights of festivity, &ldquo;living with hardly any blood in their
veins, in which the pulse beats almost entirely out of complaisance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His pictures of children are just as subtle: there is an elasticity in these
little girls with their widely
opened velvet eyes, their
rosy young lips, and their
poses calculated with so
much coquetry. Boldini has
an indescribable method of
seizing a motion of the head,
a mien, or a passing flash of
the eyes, of arranging the
hair, of indicating coquettish
lace underclothing beneath
bright silk dresses, or of
showing the grace and fineness
of the slender leg of a
girl, encased in a black silk
stocking, and dangling in
delicate lines from a light
grey sofa. There is French
<i>esprit</i>, something piquant
and with a double meaning
in his art, which borders on
the indecorous and is yet
charming. These portraits
of ladies, however, form but
a small portion of his work.
He paints in oils, in water-colour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>294</span>
and pastel, and is equally marvellous in handling the portraits of
men, the street picture and the landscape. His portrait of the painter John
Lewis Brown, crossing the street with his wife and daughter, looked as though
it had been painted in one jet. In his little pictures of horses there is an
astonishing animation and nervous energy. M. Faure, the singer, possesses
some small <i>rococo</i> pictures from his brush, scenes in the Garden of the
Tuileries, which might have come from Fortuny. His pictures from the
street life of Paris&mdash;the Place Pigalle, the Place Clichy&mdash;recall De Nittis,
and some illustrations&mdash;scenes from the great Paris races&mdash;might have been
drawn by Caran D&rsquo;Ache.</p>

<p>There is no need to treat illustration in greater detail, because, naturally,
it could no longer play the initiative part which fell to it in earlier days, now
that the whole of life had been drawn within the compass of pictorial representation.
Besides, in an epoch like our own, which is determined to know
and see and feel everything, illustration has been so extended that it would be
quite impossible even to select the most important work. Entirely apart from
the many painters who occasionally illustrated novels or other books, such as
Bastien-Lepage, Gervex, Dantan, Détaille, Dagnan-Bouveret, Ribot, Benjamin
Constant, Jean Paul Laurens, and others, there are a number of professional
draughtsmen in Paris, most of whom are really distinguished artists.</p>

<p>In particular, <i>Chéret</i>, one of the most original artists of our time&mdash;Chéret,
the great king of posters, the monarch of a fabulously charming world, in
which everything gleams in blue and red and orange, cannot be passed over
in a history of painting. The flowers which he carelessly strews on all sides
with his spendthrift hand are not destined for preservation in an historical
herbarium; his works are transient flashes of spirit, brilliantly shining,
ephemera, but a bold and subtle Parisian art is concealed amid this improvisation.
Settled for many years in London, Jules Chéret had there already
drawn admirable placards, which are now much sought after by collectors.</p>

<p>In 1866 he introduced this novel branch of industry into France, and
gave it&mdash;thanks to the invention of machines which admit of the employment
of the largest lithographic stones&mdash;an artistic development which
could not have been anticipated. He has created many thousands of posters.
The book-trade, the great shops, and almost all branches of industry owe
their success to him. His theatrical posters alone are amongst the most
graceful products of modern art: La Fête des Mitrons, La Salle de Frascati,
Les Mongolis, Le Chat Botté, L&rsquo;Athénée Comique, Fantaisies Music-Hall,
La Fée Cocotte, Les Tsiganes, Les Folies-Bergères en Voyage, Spectacle
Concert de l&rsquo;Horloge, Skating Rink, Les Pillules du Diable, La Chatte Blanche,
Le Petit Faust, La Vie Parisienne, Le Droit du Seigneur, Cendrillon, Orphée
aux Enfers, Éden Théâtre, etc. These are mere posters, destined to hang
for a few days at the street corners, and yet in graceful ease, sparkling life,
and coquettish bloom of colour they surpass many oil paintings which flaunt
upon the walls of the Musée Luxembourg.</p>

<p>Amongst the illustrators <i>Willette</i> is perhaps the most charming, the most
brilliant in grace, fancy, and spirit. A drawing by him is something living,
light, and fresh. Only amongst the Japanese, or the great draughtsmen
of the <i>rococo</i> period, does one find plates of a charm similar to Willette&rsquo;s
tender poems of the &ldquo;Chevalier Printemps&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Baiser de la Rose.&rdquo;
At the same time there is something curiously innocent, something primitive,
naïve, something like the song of a bird, in his charming art. No one can
laugh with such youthful freshness. No one has such a childlike fancy.
Willette possesses the curious gift of looking at the world like a boy of sixteen
with eyes that are not jaded for all the beauty of things, with the eyes of a
schoolboy in love for the first time. He has drawn angels for Gothic windows,
battles, and everything imaginable; nevertheless, woman is supreme over
his whole work, ruined and pure as an angel, cursed and adored, and yet
always enchanting. She is Manon Lescaut, with her soft eyes and angelically
pure sins. She has something of the lovely piquancy of the woman of Brantôme,
when she disdainfully laughs out of countenance poor Pierrot, who
sings his serenades to her plaintively in the moonlight. One might say that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>296</span>
Willette is himself his Pierrot, dazzled with the young bosoms and rosy lips:
at one time graceful and laughing, wild as a young fellow who has just escaped
from school; at another earnest and angry, like an archangel driving away
the sinful; to-day fiery, and to-morrow melancholy; now in love, teasing,
blithe, and tender, now gloomy and in mortal trouble. He laughs amid tears
and weeps amid laughter, singing the <i>Dies Iræ</i> after a couplet of Offenbach;
himself wears a black-and-white garment, and is, at the same time, mystic
and sensuous. His plates are as exhilarating as sparkling champagne, and
breathe the soft, plaintive spirit of old ballads.</p>

<p>Beside this amiable Pierrot <i>Forain</i> is like the modern Satyr, the true
outcome of the Goncourts and Gavarni, the product of the most modern
decadence. All the vice and grace of Paris, all the luxury of the world, and
all the <i>chic</i> of the <i>demi-monde</i> he has drawn with spirit, with bold stenographical
execution, and the elegance of a sure-handed expert. Every stroke is made
with trenchant energy and ultimate grace. Adultery, gambling, <i>chambres
séparées</i>, carriages, horses, villas in the Bois de Boulogne; and then the
reverse side&mdash;degradation, theft, hunger, the filth of the streets, pistols,
suicide,&mdash;such are the principal stages of the modern epic which Forain
composed; and over all the <i>Parisienne</i>, the dancing-girl, floats with smiling
grace like a breath of beauty.
His chief field of study is
the promenade of the Folies-Bergères&mdash;the
delicate profiles
of anæmic girls singing,
the heavy masses of flesh of
gluttonising <i>gourmets</i>, the
impudent laughter and lifeless
eyes of prostitutes, the
thin waists, lean arms, and
demon hips of fading bodies
laced in silk. Little dancing-girls
and fat <i>roués</i>, snobs with
short, wide overcoats, huge
collars, and long, pointed
shoes&mdash;they all move, live,
and exhale the odour of their
own peculiar atmosphere.
There is spirit in the line of
an overcoat which Forain
draws, in the furniture of a
room, in the hang of a fur or
a silk dress. He is the master
of the light, fleeting seizure
of the definitive line. Every
one of his plates is like a spirited <i>causerie</i>, which is to be understood through
nods and winks.</p>

<p>The name of <i>Paul Renouard</i> is inseparable from the opera. Degas had
already painted the opera and the ballet-dancers with wonderful reality, fine
irony, or in the weird humour of a dance of death. But Renouard did not
imitate Degas. As a pupil of Pils he was one of the many who, in 1871, were
occupied with the decoration of the staircase of the new opera house, and
through this opportunity he obtained his first glance into this capricious and
mysterious world made up of contrasts,&mdash;a world which henceforward became
his domain. All his ballet-dancers are accurately drawn at their rehearsals,
but the charm of their smile, of their figures, their silk tights, their gracious
movements, has something which almost goes beyond nature. Renouard is a
realist with very great taste. Girls practising at standing on the tips of their
toes, dancing, curtseying, and throwing kisses to the audience are broadly and
surely drawn with a few strokes. The opera is for him a universe in a nutshell&mdash;a
<i>résumé</i> of Paris, where all the oddities, all the wildness, and all the sadness
of modern life are to be found.</p>

<p>Mention must also be made of <i>Daniel Vierge</i>, torn prematurely from his
art by a cruel disease, but
not before he had been able
to complete his masterpiece,
the edition of Don Pablo de
Segovia. <i>Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec</i>
too must be named,
the grim historian of absinthe
dens, music halls and dancing
saloons; and we must give
a passing glance to <i>Léandre</i>
and <i>Steinlen</i>, in whose drawings
also the whole of Parisian
life breathes and pulsates,
with all the glitter of over-civilisation,
with all its ultra-refinement
of pleasure. But
a detailed appreciation of
these draughtsmen is obviously
out of place in a history
of painting.</p>

<p>If we turn back to those
who have done good work
in the province of painting
pure and simple, we must
tarry for a while with that
refined painter of elegiac
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>300</span>
landscape, <i>Charles Cazin</i>. He awaits us as the evening gathers, and tells
with a vibrating voice of things which induce a mood of gentle melancholy.
He has his own hour, his own world, his own men and women. His
hour is that secret and mystic time when the sun has gone down and the
moon is rising, when soft shadows repose upon the earth and bring forgetfulness.
The land he enters is a damp, misty land with dunes and
pale foliage, one that lies beneath a heavy sky and is seldom irradiated
by a beam of hope, a land of Lethe and oblivion of self, a land created
to yield to the tender colour of infinite weariness. The motives of
his landscapes are always exceedingly simple, though they have a
simplicity which is perhaps forced, instead of being entirely naïve.
He represents, it may be, the entrance into a village with a few cottages,
a few thin poplars, and reddish tiled roofs, bathed in the pale shadows of
evening. Upon the broad street lined with irregular houses, in a provincial
town, the rain comes splashing down. Or it is night, and in the sky there
are black clouds, with the moon softly peering between them. Lamps are
gleaming in the windows of the houses, and an old post-chaise rolling
heavily over the slippery pavement. Or dun-green shadows repose upon
a solitary green field with a windmill and a sluggish stream. The
earth is wrapt in mysterious silence, and there is movement only in
the sky, where a flash of lightning quivers&mdash;not one that blazes into intensely
vivid light, but rather a silvery white electric spark lambent in the
dark firmament. Corot alone has painted such things, but where he is joyous
Cazin is elegiac. The little solitary houses are of a ghostly grey. The trees
sway towards each other as if in tremulous fear. And the mist hangs damp
in the brown boughs. Faint evening shadows flit around. A Northern
malaria seems to prevail. At times a sea-bird utters a wailing complaint.
One thinks of Russian novels, Nihilism, and Raskolnikoff, though I know
not through what association of ideas. One is disposed to sit by the wayside
and dream, as Verlaine sings:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sometimes the humour of the
landscape is associated with the
memory of kindred feelings which
passages in the Bible or in old
legends have awakened in him. In
such cases he creates the biblical or
mythological pictures which have
principally occupied him in recent
years. Grey-green dusk rests upon
the earth; the shadows of evening
drive away the last rays of the sun.
A mother with her child is sitting
upon a bundle of straw in front of
a thatched cottage with a ladder
leaning against its roof, and a
poverty-stricken yard bordered by
an old paling, while a man in a
brown mantle stands beside her,
leaning upon a stick: this picture
is &ldquo;The Birth of Christ.&rdquo; Two
solitary people, a man and a woman,
are walking through a soft, undulating
country. The sun is sinking.
No house will give the weary
wanderers shelter in the night, but
the shade of evening, which is
gradually descending, envelops them with its melancholy peace: this is
&ldquo;The Flight into Egypt.&rdquo; An arid waste of sand, with a meagre bush
rising here and there, and the parching summer sun brooding sultry overhead,
forms the landscape of the picture &ldquo;Hagar and Ishmael.&rdquo; Or the
fortifications of a mediæval town are represented. Night is drawing on,
watch-fires are burning, brawny figures stand at the anvil fashioning
weapons, and the sentinels pace gravely along the moat. The besieged
town is Bethulia, and the woman who issues with a wild glance from the
town gateway is Judith, going forth followed by her handmaid to slay
Holofernes. Through such works Cazin has become the creator of the
landscape of religious sentiment, which has since occupied so much space in
French and German painting. The costume belongs to no time in particular,
though it is almost more appropriate to the present than to bygone ages;
but something so biblical, so patriarchal, such a remote and mystical
poetry is expressed in the great lines of the landscape that the figures
seem like visions from a far-off past.</p>

<p>The continuation of this movement is marked by that charming artist
who delighted in mystery, <i>Eugène Carrière</i>, &ldquo;the modern painter of Madonnas,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>302</span>
as he has been called by Edmond de Goncourt. Probably no one before
him has painted the unconscious spiritual life of children with the same
tender, absorbed feeling: little hands grasping at something, stammering
lips of little ones who would kiss their mother, dreamy eyes gazing into
infinity. But although young children at the beginning of life, whose eyes
open wide as they turn towards the future, look out of his pictures, a profound
sadness rests over them. His figures move gravely and silently in a soft,
mysterious dusk, as though divided from the world of realities by a veil of
gauze. All forms seem to melt, and fading flowers shed a sleepy fragrance
around; it is as though there were bats flitting invisible through the air.
Even as a portrait painter he is still a poet dreaming in eternal haze and a
twilight of mystery. In his portraits, Alphonse Daudet, Geffroy, Dolent,
and Edmond de Goncourt looked as though they had been resolved into
vapour, although the delineation of character was of astonishing power,
and marked firmly with a penetrative insight into spiritual life such as was
shared by Ribot alone.</p>

<p>At the very opposite pole of art stands <i>Paul Albert Besnard</i>: amongst the
worshippers of light he is, perhaps, the most subtle and forcible poet, a
luminist who cannot find tones high enough when he would play upon the
fibres of the spirit. Having issued from the École des Beaux-Arts, and gained
the <i>Prix de Rome</i> with a work which attracted much notice, he had long
moved upon strictly official lines; and he only broke from his academical
strait-waistcoat about a dozen years ago, to become the refined artist to
whom the younger generation do honour in these days, a seeker whose works
vary widely in point of merit, though they always strike one afresh from the
bold confidence with which he attacks and solves the most difficult problems
of light. In Puvis de Chavannes, Cazin, and Carrière a reaction towards
sombre effect and pale, vaporous beauty of tone followed the brightness of
Manet; but Besnard, pushing forward upon Manet&rsquo;s course, revels in the
most subtle effects of illumination&mdash;effects not ventured upon even by the
boldest Impressionists&mdash;endeavours to arrest the most unexpected and unforeseen
phases of light, and the most hazardous combinations of colour.
The ruddy glow of the fire glances upon faded flowers. Chandeliers and
tapers outshine the soft radiance of the lamp; artificial light struggles with
the sudden burst of daylight; and lanterns, standing out against the night
sky like golden lights with a purple border, send their glistening rays into
the blue gloom. It is only in the field of literature that a parallel may be
found in Jens Pieter Jacobsen, who in his novels occasionally describes with
a similar finesse of perception the reflection of fire upon gold and silver, upon
silk and satin, upon red and yellow and blue, or enumerates the hundred
tints in which the September sun pours into a room.</p>

<p>The portrait group of his children is a harmony in red. A boy and two
girls are standing, with the most delightful absence of all constraint, in a
country room, which looks out upon a mountainous landscape. The wall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>303</span>
of the background is red, and red the costume of the little ones, yet all these
conflicting <i>nuances</i> of red tones are brought into harmonious unity with
inherent taste. Rubens would have rejoiced over a second landscape exhibited
in the same year. A nude woman is seated upon a divan drinking
tea, with her feet tucked under her and her back to the spectator. Upon her
back are cast the warm and the more subdued reflections of a fire which lies
out of sight and of the daylight quivering in yellowish stripes, like a glowing
aureole upon her soft skin.</p>

<p>In a third picture, called &ldquo;Vision de Femme,&rdquo; a young woman with the
upper part of her form unclothed appears upon a terrace, surrounded by red
blooming flowers and the glowing yellow light of the moon. Under this
symbol Besnard imagined Lutetia, the eternally young, hovering over the
rhododendrons of the Champs Elysées and looking down upon the blaze of
lights in the Café des Ambassadeurs. In 1889 he produced &ldquo;The Siren,&rdquo; a
symphony in red. A <i>petite femme</i> of Montmartre stands wearily in a half-antique
morning toilette before a billowing lake, which glows beneath the
rays of the setting sun in fiery red and dull mallow colour. In his &ldquo;Autumn&rdquo;
of 1890 he made the same experiment in green. The moon casts its silvery
light upon the changeful greenish mirror of a lake, and at the same time plays
in a thousand reflections upon the green silk dress of a lady sitting upon the
shore; while, in a picture of 1891, a young lady in an elegant <i>négligé</i> is
seated at the piano, with her husband beside her turning over the music.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>304</span>
The light of the candles is shed over hands, faces, and clothes. Another
picture, called &ldquo;Clouds of Evening,&rdquo; represented a woman with delicate
profile amid a violet landscape over which the clouds were lightly hovering,
touched with orange-red by the setting sun. The double portrait, executed
in 1892, of the &ldquo;Mlles. D&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; one of whom is leisurely placing a scarf over
her shoulders with a movement almost recalling Leighton, while the other
stoops to pick a blossom from a rhododendron bush, is exceedingly soft in
its green, red, and blue harmony.</p>

<p>The French Government recognised the eminent decorative talent displayed
in these pictures, and gave Besnard the opportunity of achieving
further triumphs as a mural painter. Here, too, he is modern to his fingertips,
knowing nothing of stately gestures, nothing of old-world naïveté; but
merely through his appetising and sparkling play of colour he has the art of
converting great blank spaces into a marvellous storied realm.</p>

<p>In 1890 he had to represent &ldquo;Astronomy&rdquo; as a ceiling-piece for the Salon
des Sciences in the Hôtel de Ville. Ten years before there would have been
no artist who would not have executed this task by the introduction of nude
figures provided with instructive attributes. One would have held a globe,
the second a pair of compasses, and the third a telescope in one hand, and in
the other branches of laurel wherewith to crown Galileo, Columbus, or Kepler.
Besnard made a clean sweep of all this. He did not forget that a ceiling is
a kind of sky, and accordingly he painted the planets themselves, the stars
which run their course through the firmament of blue. The figures of the
constellations are arranged in a gracious interplay of light bodies floating
softly past. Amongst the pictures of the École de Pharmacie a like effect is
produced by Besnard&rsquo;s great composition &ldquo;Evening,&rdquo; a work treated with
august simplicity. The atmosphere is of a grey-bluish white: stars are
glittering here and there, and two very ancient beings, a man and a woman,
sit upon the threshold of their house, grave, weather-beaten forms of quiet
grandeur, executed with expressive lines. The old man casts a searching
glance at the stars, as if yearning after immortality, while the woman leans
weary and yet contented upon his shoulder. In the room behind a kettle
hangs bubbling over the fire, and a young woman with a child upon her arm
steps through the door: man and the starry world, the finite and the infinite,
presented under plain symbols.</p>

<p>Such are, more or less, the representative minds of contemporary France,
the centres from which other minds issue like rays. <i>Alfred Agache</i> devotes
himself with great dexterity to an allegorical style after the fashion of Barroccio.
Inspired by the pre-Raphaelites, <i>Aman-Jean</i> has found the model
for his allegorical compositions in Botticelli, and is a neurasthenic in colour,
which is exceptionally striking, in his delicate portraits of women. <i>Maurice
Denis</i>, who drew the illustrations to Verlaine&rsquo;s <i>Sagesse</i> in a style full of archaic
bloom, as a painter takes delight in the intoxicating fragrance of incense,
the gliding steps and slow, quiet movements of nuns, in men and women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>305</span>
kneeling before the altar in prayer, and priests crossing themselves before
the golden statue of the Virgin. The Spaniard <i>Gandara</i>, who lives in Paris,
displays in his grey and melting portraits much feeling for the decorative
swing of lines. That spirited &ldquo;pointillist&rdquo; <i>Henri Martin</i> seems for the
present to have reached a climax in his &ldquo;Cain and Abel,&rdquo; one of the most
powerful creations of the younger generation in France. <i>Louis Picard&rsquo;s</i>
work has a tincture of literature, and he delights in Edgar Allan Poe, mysticism
and psychology. <i>Ary Renan</i>, the son of Ernest Renan and the grandson
of Ary Scheffer, has given the soft subdued tones of Puvis de Chavannes a
tender Anglo-Saxon fragrance in the manner of Walter Crane. And that
spirited artist in lithograph, <i>Odilon Redon</i>, has visions of distorted faces,
flowers that no mortal eye has seen, and huge white sea-birds screaming as they
fly across a black world. Forebodings like those we read of in the verse of
Poe take shape in his works, ghosts roam in the broad daylight, and the
sea-green eyes of Medusa-heads dripping with blood shine in the darkness of
night with a mesmeric effect. <i>Carlos Schwabe</i> drew the illustrations for the
<i>Évangile de l&rsquo;Enfance</i> of Catulle Mendès with the charming naïveté of Hans
Memlinc, and afterwards attracted attention by his delicate, archaic pictures.</p>

<p><i>Bonnard</i>, <i>Vuillard</i>, <i>Valloton</i> and <i>Roussel</i> are others whose names have in
the last few years become well known. Their art is built up on the foundation
laid by the Impressionists only so far as they use the new colour-values
discovered by the &ldquo;bright painters,&rdquo; in a free, harmonious manner, and place
them at the service of a new decorative purpose. In exhibitions one is often
at a loss how to view these decorative paintings, such, for instance, as those
of Bonnard and Vuillard; the eye is astounded for a moment when, after
looking at the usual array of good pictures, it suddenly comes upon works
that look more like pieces of Gobelin tapestry than paintings. Then one&rsquo;s
mind reverts to rooms such as Olbrich, Van de Velde, or Josef Hoffmann
designed with some particular purpose in view, and one understands the object
of these pictures. &ldquo;We can hang in our rooms any picture which is beautiful
in itself and by itself.&rdquo; That is the old familiar story, but that feeling never
enters our minds when we stand in a mediæval room in which there are no
pictures that can be taken away from their surroundings. It is a difficult
task to arrange things that are individually beautiful into a harmonious
whole. The realisation of the old-time principle is for obvious reasons well-nigh
impracticable&mdash;the modern man is a restless, fickle creature; he must
always be at liberty to pitch his tent anywhere&mdash;but we can surely make
some approach to it. One may imagine in every dwelling a room in which
furniture and pictures are made to fit into some conception of harmony, and
the works of Bonnard and Vuillard may be conceived as parts of such a scheme
for the decoration of a room, and indeed&mdash;though we must not forget similar
attempts which have been made in other directions&mdash;as parts of a scheme
which, though thoroughly modern and by no means a mere external copy,
reverts to the style of bygone centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>306</span></p>

<p>From the historian&rsquo;s standpoint these young artists scarcely come into
question; they are still too much in the embryonic stage for any conclusion
to be arrived at with respect to either of them. But the art lover who looks
to the future rather than the past feels bound to follow with care their creations,
in which the wealth of beauty that is already indicated in their first prints,
the certainty of purpose with which they direct their efforts towards the
point at which Impressionism has left the widest gap, seems to give a guarantee
that in the future France will maintain in the province of art the position
she has held during the nineteenth century as the leading artistic nation.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Just</span> as France to-day shows such a wealth of talent, Spain, correspondingly,
can scarcely be said to come into the question of modern endeavour
in art; in fact, it is quite impossible to treat of a history of Spanish art,
one can only consider individual artists, for they each go their own way,
working in different directions and without any concerted plan.</p>

<p>It was in the spring of 1870 that a little picture called &ldquo;La Vicaria&rdquo; was
exhibited in Paris at the dealer Goupil&rsquo;s. A marriage is taking place in the
sacristy of a <i>rococo</i> church in Madrid. The walls are covered with faded
Cordova leather hangings figured in gold and dull colours, and a magnificent
<i>rococo</i> screen separates the sacristy from the middle aisle. Venetian lustres
are suspended from the ceiling; pictures of martyrs, Venetian glasses in carved
oval frames hang on the wall, richly ornamented wooden benches, and a library
of missals and gospels in sparkling silver clasps, and shining marble tables and
glistening braziers form part of the scene in which the marriage contract is being
signed. The costumes are those of the time of Goya. As a matter of fact, an old
beau is marrying a young and beautiful girl. With affected grace and a skipping
minuet step, holding a modish three-cornered hat under his arm, he approaches
the table to put his signature in the place which the <i>escribano</i> points out with
an obsequious bow. He is arrayed in delicate lilac, while the bride is wearing
a white silk dress trimmed with flowered lace, and has a wreath of orange
blossoms in her luxuriant black hair. As a girl-friend is talking to her she
examines with abstracted attention the pretty little pictures upon her fan,
the finest she has ever possessed. A very piquant little head she has, with her
long lashes and her black eyes. Then, in the background, follow the witnesses,
and first of all a young lady in a swelling silk dress of the brightest rose-colour.
Beside her is one of the bridegroom&rsquo;s friends in a cabbage-green coat with long
flaps, and a shining belt from which a gleaming sabre hangs. The whole picture
is a marvellous assemblage of colours, in which tones of Venetian glow and
strength, the tender pearly grey beloved of the Japanese, and a melting neutral
brown, each sets off the other and give a shimmering effect to the whole.</p>

<p>The painter, who was barely thirty, bore the name of <i>Mariano Fortuny</i>,
and was born in Reus, a little town in the province of Tarragona, on 11th June
1838. Five years after he had completed this work he died, at the age of
thirty-six, on 21st November 1874. Short as his career was, it was, nevertheless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>308</span>
so brilliant, his success so immense, his influence so great, that his place in
the history of modern painting remains assured to him.</p>

<p>Like French art, Spanish art, after Goya&rsquo;s death, had borne the yoke of
Classicism, Romanticism, and academical influence by turns. In the grave of
Goya there was buried for ever, as it seemed, the world of torreros, majas,
manolas, monks, smugglers, knaves, and witches, and all the local colour of
the Spanish Peninsula. As late as the Paris World Exhibition of 1867, Spain
was merely represented by a few carefully composed, and just as carefully
painted, but tame and tedious, historical pictures of the David or the Delaroche
stamp&mdash;works such as had been painted for whole decades by José Madrazo,
J. Ribera y Fernandez, Federigo Madrazo, Carlo Luis Ribera, Eduardo Rosales,
and many others whose names there is no reason for rescuing from oblivion.
They laboured, meditating an art which was not their own, and could not
waken any echo in themselves. Their painting was body without soul, empty
histrionic skill. As complete darkness had rested for a century over Spanish
art, from the death of Claudio Coellos in 1693 to the appearance of Goya, rising
like a meteor, so the first half of the nineteenth century produced no single
original artist until Fortuny came forward in the sixties.</p>

<p>He grew up amid poor surroundings, and when he was twelve years of age
he lost his father and mother. His grandfather, an enterprising and adventurous
joiner, had made for himself a cabinet of wax figures, which he exhibited
from town to town in the province of Tarragona. With his grandson he
went on foot through all the towns of Catalonia, the old man showing the
wax figures which the boy had painted. Whenever he had a moment free
the latter was drawing, carving in wood, or modelling in wax. It chanced,
however, that a sculptor saw his attempts, spoke of them in Fortuny&rsquo;s
birthplace, and succeeded in inducing the town to make an allowance of
forty-two francs a month to a lad whose talent had so much promise. By
these means Fortuny was enabled to attend the Academy of Barcelona
for four years. In 1857, when he was nineteen years of age, he received
the <i>Prix de Rome</i>, and set out for Rome itself in the same year. But
whilst he was copying the pictures of the old masters there a circumstance
occurred which set him upon another course. The war between
Spain and the Emperor of Morocco determined his future career. Fortuny
was then a young man of three-and-twenty, very strong, rather
thick-set, quick to resent an injury, taciturn, resolute, and accustomed to
hard work. His residence in the East, which lasted from five to six months,
was a discovery for him&mdash;a feast of delight. He found the opportunity
of studying in the immediate neighbourhood a people whose life was
opulent in colour and wild in movement; and he beheld with wonder the
gleaming pictorial episodes so variously enacted before him, and the rich
costumes upon which the radiance of the South glanced in a hundred reflections.
And, in particular, when the Emperor of Morocco came with his
brilliant suite to sign the treaty of peace, Fortuny developed a feverish activity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>309</span>
The great battle-piece which he should have executed on the commission of
the Academy of Barcelona remained unfinished. On the other hand, he
painted a series of Oriental pictures, in which his astonishing dexterity and his
marvellously sensitive eye were already to be clearly discerned: the stalls of
Moorish carpet-sellers, with little figures swarming about them, and the rich
display of woven stuffs of the East; the weary attitude of old Arabs sitting in
the sun; the sombre, brooding faces of strange snake-charmers and magicians.
This is no Parisian East, like Fromentin&rsquo;s; every one here speaks Arabic.
Guillaumet alone, who afterwards interpreted the fakir world of the East,
dreamy and contemplative in the sunshine, has been equally convincing.</p>

<p>Yet Fortuny first discovered his peculiar province when he began, after
his return, to paint those brilliant kaleidoscopic <i>rococo</i> pictures with their
charming play of colour, the pictures which founded his reputation in Paris.
Even in the earliest, representing gentlemen of the <i>rococo</i> period examining
engravings in a richly appointed interior, the Japanese weapons, Renaissance
chests, gilded frames of carved wood, and all the delightful <i>petit-riens</i> from the
treasury of the past which he had heaped together in it, were so wonderfully
painted that Goupil began a connection with him and ordered further works.
This commission occasioned his journey, in the autumn of 1866, to Paris,
where he entered into Meissonier&rsquo;s circle, and worked sometimes at Gérôme&rsquo;s.
Yet neither of them exerted any influence upon him at all worth mentioning.
The French painter in miniature is probably the father of the department
of art to which Fortuny belongs; but the latter united to the delicate execution
of the Frenchman the flashing, gleaming spirit of the Latin races of the South.
He is a Meissonier with <i>esprit</i> recalling
Goya. In his picture &ldquo;The
Spanish Marriage&rdquo; (La Vicaria) all
the vivid, throbbing, <i>rococo</i> world,
buried with Goya, revived once
more. While in his Oriental pieces&mdash;&ldquo;The
Praying Arab,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Arabian Fantasia,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Snake Charmers&rdquo;&mdash;he still aimed
at concentration and unity of effect,
this picture had something gleaming,
iridescent and pearly, which soon
became the delight of all collectors.
Fortuny&rsquo;s successes, his celebrity,
and his fortune dated from that
time. His fame flashed forth like
a meteor. After fighting long years
in vain, not for recognition, but for
his very bread, he suddenly became
the most honored painter of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span>
day, and began to exert upon a whole generation of young artists that
powerful influence which survives even at this very day.</p>

<p>The studio which he built for himself after his marriage with the daughter
of Federigo Madrazo in Rome was a little museum of the most exquisite
products of the artistic crafts of the West and the East: the walls were decorated
with brilliant oriental stuffs, and great glass cabinets with Moorish and
Arabian weapons, and old tankards and glasses from Murano stood around.
He sought and collected everything that shines and gleams in varying colour.
That was his world, and the basis of his art.</p>

<p>Pillars of marble and porphyry, groups of ivory and bronze, lustres of
Venetian glass, gilded consoles with small busts, great tables supported by
gilded satyrs and inlaid with variegated mosaics, form the surroundings of that
astonishing work &ldquo;The Trial of the Model.&rdquo; Upon a marble table a young girl
is standing naked, posing before a row of academicians in the costume of the
Louis <span class="sc">XV</span> period, while each one of them gives his judgment by a movement
or an expression of the face. One of them has approached quite close, and is
examining the little woman through his lorgnette. All the costumes gleam
in a thousand hues, which the marble reflects. By his picture &ldquo;The Poet&rdquo; or
&ldquo;The Rehearsal&rdquo; he reached his highest point in the capricious analysis of
light. In an old <i>rococo</i> garden, with the brilliant façade of the Alhambra
as its background, there is a gathering of gentlemen assembled to witness the
rehearsal of a tragedy. The heroine, a tall, charming, luxuriant beauty, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>311</span>
just fallen into a faint. On the other hand, the hero, holding the lady on his
right arm, is reading the verses of his part from a large manuscript. The
gentlemen are listening, and exchanging remarks with the air of connoisseurs;
one of them closes his eyes to listen with thorough attention. Here the entire
painting flashes like a rocket, and is as iridescent and brilliant as a peacock&rsquo;s
tail. Fortuny splits the rays of the sun into endless <i>nuances</i> which are scarcely
perceptible to the eye, and gives expression to their flashing glitter with
astonishing delicacy. Henri Regnault, who visited him at that time in Rome,
wrote to a Parisian friend: &ldquo;The time I spent with Fortuny yesterday is
haunting me still. What a magnificent fellow he is! He paints the most
marvellous things, and is the master of us all. I wish I could show you the two
or three pictures that he has in hand, or his etchings and water-colours. They
inspired me with a real disgust of my own. Ah! Fortuny, you spoil my sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even as an etcher he caught all the technical finesses and appetising
piquancies of his great forerunner Goya. It is only with very light and
spirited strokes that the outlines of his figures are drawn; then, as in Goya,
comes the aquatint, the colour which covers the background and gives locality,
depth, and light. A few scratches with a needle, a black spot, a light made by
a judiciously inserted patch of white, and he gives his figures life and character,
causing them to emerge from the black depth of the background like mysterious
visions. &ldquo;The Dead Arab,&rdquo; covered with his black cloak, and lying on the
ground with his musket on his arm, &ldquo;The Shepherd&rdquo; on the stump of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>312</span>
pillar, &ldquo;The Serenade,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Reader,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Tambourine Player,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Pensioner,&rdquo; the picture of the gentleman with a pig-tail bending over his
flowers, &ldquo;The Anchorite,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Arab mourning over the Body of his
Friend,&rdquo; are the most important of his plates, which are sometimes pungent
and spirited, and sometimes sombre and fantastic.</p>

<p>In the picture &ldquo;The Strand of Portici&rdquo; he attempted to strike out a new
path. He was tired of the gay rags of the eighteenth century, as he said
himself, and meant to paint for the future only subjects from surrounding
life in an entirely modern manner like that of Manet. But he was not destined
to carry out this change any further. He passed away in Rome on 21st
November 1874. When the unsold works which he left were put up to
auction the smallest sketches fetched high figures, and even his etchings were
bought at marvellous prices.</p>

<p>In these days the enthusiasm for Fortuny is no longer so glowing. The
capacity to paint became so ordinary in the course of years that it was presupposed
as a matter of course; it was a necessary acquirement for an artist
to have before approaching his pictures in a psychological fashion. And in
this later respect there is a deficiency in Fortuny. He is a <i>charmeur</i> who
dazzles the eyes, but rather creates a sense of astonishment than holds the
spectator in his grip. Beneath his hands painting has become a matter of
pure virtuosity, a marvellous, flaring firework that amazes and&mdash;leaves us cold
after all. With enchanting delicacy he runs through the brilliant gamut of
radiant colours upon the small keyboard of his little pictures painted with a
pocket-lens, and everything glitters golden, like the dress of a fairy. He
united to the patience of Meissonier a delicacy of colour, a wealth of pictorial
point, and a crowd of delightful trifles, which combine to make him a most
exquisite and fascinating juggler of the palette&mdash;an amazing colourist, a
wonderful clown, an original and subtle painter with vibrating nerves, but
not a truly great and moving artist. His pictures are dainties in gold frames,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>313</span>
jewels delicately set, astonishing efforts of patience lit up by a flashing,
rocket-like <i>esprit</i>; but beneath the glittering surface one is conscious of there
being neither heart nor soul. His art might have been French or Italian, just
as appropriately as Spanish. It is the art of virtuosi of the brush, and
Fortuny himself is the initiator of a religion which found its enthusiastic
followers, not in Madrid alone, but in Naples, Paris, and Rome.</p>

<p>Yet Spanish painting, so far as it is individual, works even now upon the
lines of Fortuny. After his death it divided into two streams. The official
endeavour of the academies was to keep the grand historical painting in
flower, in accord with the proud programme announced by Francisco Tubino
in his brochure, <i>The Renaissance of Spanish Art</i>. &ldquo;Our contemporary artists,&rdquo;
he writes, &ldquo;fill all civilised Europe with their fame, and are the object of
admiration on the far side of the Atlantic. We have a peculiar school of our
own with a hundred teachers, and it shuns comparison with no school in
any other country. At home the Academy of the Fine Arts watches over the
progress of painting; it has perfected the laws by which our Academy in Rome
is guided, the Academy in the proud possession of Spain, and situated so
splendidly upon the Janiculum. In Madrid there is a succession of biennial
exhibitions, and there is no deficiency in prizes nor in purchases. Spanish
painting does not merely adorn the citizen&rsquo;s house or the boudoir of the fair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>314</span>
sex with easel-pieces; by its productions it recalls the great episodes of popular
history, which are able to excite men to glorious deeds. Austere, like our
national character, it forbids fine taste to descend to the painting of anything
indecorous. Before everything we want grand paintings for our galleries;
the commercial spirit is no master of ours. In such a way the glory of
Zurburan, Murillo, and Velasquez lives once more in a new sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The results of such efforts were those historical pictures which at the Paris
World Exhibition of 1878, the Munich International Exhibition of 1883, and
at every large exhibition since have been so exceedingly refreshing to all
admirers of the illustration of history upon ground that was genuinely Spanish.
At the Paris World Exhibition of 1878 <i>Pradilla&rsquo;s</i> &ldquo;Joan the Mad&rdquo; received
the large gold medal, and was, indeed, a good picture in the manner of Laurens.
Philip the Fair is dead. The funeral train, paying him the last honours, has
come to a halt upon a high-road, and the unhappy princess rushes up with
floating hair and staring eyes fixed upon the bier which hides the remains of
her husband. The priests and women kneeling around regard the unfortunate
mad woman with mournful pity. To the right the members of the Court are
grouped near a little chapel where a priest is celebrating a mass for the dead;
to the left the peasantry are
crowding round to witness the
ceremony. Great wax candles
are burning, and the chapel is
lit up with the sombre glow of
torches. This was all exceedingly
well painted, carefully
balanced in composition, and
graceful in drawing. At the
Munich Exhibition of 1883 he
received a gold medal for his
&ldquo;Surrender of Granada, 1492,&rdquo;
a picture which made a great
impression at the time upon
the German historical painters,
as Pradilla had made a transition
from the brown bituminous
painting of Laurens to a
&ldquo;modern&rdquo; painting in grey,
which did more justice to the
illumination of objects beneath
the open sky. In the same
year <i>Casado&rsquo;s</i> large painting,
&ldquo;The Bells of Huesca,&rdquo; with
the ground streaming with
blood, fifteen decapitated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>315</span>
bodies, and as many bodiless heads, was a creation which was widely
admired. <i>Vera</i> had exhibited his picture, filled with wild fire and pathos,
&ldquo;The Defence of Numantia,&rdquo; and <i>Manuel Ramirez</i> his &ldquo;Execution of Don
Alvaro de Luna,&rdquo; with the pallid head which has rolled from the steps and
stares at the spectator in such a ghastly manner. In his &ldquo;Conversion of the
Duke of Gandia,&rdquo; <i>Moreno Carbonero</i> displayed an open coffin <i>à la</i> Laurens: as
Grand Equerry to the Empress Isabella at the Court of Charles V, the Duke of
Gandia, after the death of his mistress, has to superintend the burial of her
corpse in the vault at Granada, and as the coffin is opened there, to confirm the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span>
identity of the person, the distorted features of the dead make such a powerful
impression upon the careless noble that he takes a vow to devote himself to
God. <i>Ricardo Villodas</i> in his picture &ldquo;Victoribus Gloria&rdquo; represents the
beginning of one of those sea-battles which Augustus made gladiators fight for
the amusement of the Roman people. By <i>Antonio Casanova y Estorach</i> there
was a picture of King Ferdinand the Holy, who upon Maundy Thursday is
washing the feet of eleven poor old men and giving them food. And a special
sensation was made by the great ghost picture of <i>Benliure y Gil</i>, which he
named &ldquo;A Vision in the Colosseum.&rdquo; Saint Almaquio, who was slain, according
to tradition, by gladiators in the Colosseum, is seen floating in the air, as he
swings in fanatical ecstasy a crucifix from which light is streaming. Upon
one side men who have borne witness to Christianity with their blood chant
their hymns of praise; upon the other, troops of female martyrs clothed in
white and holding tapers in their hands move by; but below, the earth has
opened, and the dead rise for the celebration of this midnight service, praying
from their graves, while the full moon shines through the apertures of the
ruins and pours its pale light upon the phantom congregation. There was
exhibited by <i>Checa</i> &ldquo;A Barbarian Onset,&rdquo; a Gallic horde of riders thundering
past a Roman temple, from which the priestesses are flying in desperation.
<i>Francisco Amerigo</i> treated upon a huge canvas a scene from the sacking of
Rome in 1527, when the despoiling troops of Charles V plundered the Eternal
City. &ldquo;Soldiers intoxicated with wine and lust, tricked out with bishops&rsquo;
mitres and wrapped in the robes of priests, are desecrating the temples of
God. Nunneries are violated, and fathers kill their daughters to save them
from shame.&rdquo; So ran the historical explanation set upon the broad gold
frame.</p>

<p>But, after all, these historical pictures, in spite of their great spaces of
canvas, are of no consequence when one comes to characterise the efforts of
modern art. Explanations could be given showing that in the land of bull-fights
this painting of horrors maintained itself longer than elsewhere, but
the hopes of those who prophesied from it a new golden period for historical
painting were entirely disappointed. For Spanish art, as in earlier days for
French art, the historical picture has merely the importance implied by the
<i>Prix de Rome</i>. A method of colouring which is often dazzling in result, and
a vigorous study of nature, preserved from the danger of &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; tinting,
make the Spanish works different from the older ones. Their very passion
often has an effect which is genuine, brutal, and of telling power. In the
best of these pictures one believes that a wild temperament really does burst
into flame through the accepted convention that the painters have delight
in the horrible, which the older French artists resorted to merely for the
purpose of preparing veritable <i>tableaux</i>. But in the rank and file, in place
of the Southern vividness of expression which has been sincerely felt, histrionic
pose is the predominant element, the petty situation of the stage set upon
a gigantic canvas, and in addition to this a straining after effect which grazes
the boundary line where the horrible degenerates into the ridiculous. Through
their extraordinary ability they all compel respect, but they have not enriched
the treasury of modern emotion, nor have they transformed the older historical
painting in the essence of its being. And the man who handles again and
again motives derived from what happens to be the mode in colours renders
no service to art.  Delaroche is dead; but though he may be disinterred he
cannot be brought to life, and the Spaniards merely dug out of the earth
mummies in which the breath of life was wanting. Their works are not
directing-posts to the future, but the last <i>revenants</i> of that histrionic spirit
which wandered like a ghost through the art of all nations. Even the composition,
the shining colours, the settles and carpets picturesquely spread

<p>And these conceptions, nourished upon historical painting, had an injurious
influence upon the handling of the modern picture of the period. Even here
there is an endeavour to make a compromise with the traditional historic
picture, since artists painted scenes from modern popular life upon great
spaces of canvas, transforming them into pageants or pictures of tragical
ceremonies, and sought too much after subjects with which the splendid and
motley colours of historical painting would accord. <i>Viniegra y Lasso</i> and
<i>Mas y Fondevilla</i> execute great processions filing past, with bishops, monks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>320</span>
priests, and choristers. All the figures stand beaming in brightness against
the sky, but the light glances from the oily mantles of the figures without
real effect. <i>Alcazar Tejedor</i> paints a young priest reading his &ldquo;First Mass&rdquo;
in the presence of his parents, and merely renders a theatrical scene in modern
costume, merely transfers to an event of the present that familiar &ldquo;moment
of highest excitement&rdquo; so popular since the time of Delaroche. By his
&ldquo;Death of the Matador,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Christening,&rdquo; bought by Vanderbilt
for a hundred and fifty thousand francs, <i>José Villegas</i>, in ability the most
striking of them all, acquired a European name; whilst a hospital scene by
<i>Luis Jimenez</i> of Seville is the single picture in which something of the
seriousness of French Naturalism is perceptible, but it is an isolated example
from a province of interest which is otherwise not to be found in Spain.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Spaniards are by no means most attractive in gravely ceremonial
and stiffly dignified pictures, but rather when they indulge in unpretentious
&ldquo;little painting&rdquo; in the manner of Fortuny. Yet even these wayward &ldquo;little
painters,&rdquo; with their varied glancing colour, are not to be properly reckoned
amongst the moderns. Their painting is an art dependent on deftness
of hand, and knows no higher aim than to bring together in a picture as many
brilliant things as possible, to make a charming bouquet with glistening
effects of costume, and the play, the reflections, and the caprices of sunbeams.
The earnest modern art which sprang from Manet and the Fontainebleau
painters avoids this kaleidoscopic sport with varied spots of colour. All
these little folds and mouldings, these prismatic arts of blending, and these
curious reflections are what the moderns have no desire to see: they half
close their eyes to gain a clearer conception of the chief values; they simplify;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>321</span>
they refuse to be led from the main point by a thousand trifles. Their pictures
are works of art, while those of the disciples of Fortuny are sleights of artifice.
In all this <i>bric-à-brac</i> art there is no question of any earnest analysis of light.
The motley spots of colour yield, no doubt, a certain concord of their own;
but there is a want of tone and air, a want of all finer sentiment: everything
seems to have been dyed, instead of giving the effect of colour. Nevertheless
those who were independent enough not to let themselves be entirely bewitched
by the deceptive adroitness of a conjurer have painted little pictures
of talent and refinement; taking Fortuny&rsquo;s <i>rococo</i> works as their starting-point,
they have represented the fashionable world and the highly coloured
and warm-blooded life of the people of modern Spain with a bold and spirited
facility. But they have not gone beyond the observation of the external
sides of life. They can show guitarreros clattering with castanets and pandarets,
majas dancing, and ribboned heroes conquering bulls instead of Jews
and Moors. Yet their pictures are at any rate blithe, full of colour, flashing
with sensuous brilliancy, and at times they are executed with stupendous
skill.</p>

<p><i>Martin Rico</i> was for the longest period in Italy with Fortuny, and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>322</span>
pictures also have the glitter of a casket of jewels, the pungency of sparkling
champagne. Some of his sea-pieces in particular&mdash;for instance, those of
the canal in Venice and the Bay of Fontarabia&mdash;might have been painted
by Fortuny. In others he seems quieter and more harmonious than the
latter. His execution is more powerful, less marked by spirited stippling,
and his light gains in intensity and atmospheric refinement what it loses
in mocking caprices, while his little figures have a more animated effect, notwithstanding
the less piquant manner in which they are painted. Their
outlines are scarcely perceptible, and yet they are seen walking, jostling,
and pressing against each other; whereas those of Fortuny, precisely through
the more subtle and microscopic method in which they have been executed,
often seem as though they were benumbed in movement. Certain market
scenes, with a dense crowd of buyers and sellers, are peculiarly spirited, rapid
sketches, with a gleaming charm of colour.</p>

<p><i>Zamacois</i>, <i>Casanova</i>, and <i>Raimundo de Madrazo</i>, Fortuny&rsquo;s brother-in-law,
show no less virtuosity of the palette. Sea-pieces and little landscapes alternate
with scenes from Spanish popular life, where they revel, like Fortuny,
in a scintillating medley of colour. Later, in Paris, Madrazo was likewise
much sought after as a painter of ladies&rsquo; portraits, as he lavished on his
pictures sometimes a fine <i>hautgoût</i> of fragrant <i>rococo</i> grace <i>a la</i> Chaplin,
and sometimes devoted himself with taste and deftness to symphonic <i>tours
de force à la</i> Carolus Duran. Particularly memorable is the portrait of a
graceful young girl in red, exhibited in the Munich Exhibition of 1883. She
is seated upon a sofa of crimson silk, and her feet rest upon a dark red carpet.
Equally memorable in the Paris World Exhibition of 1889 was a pierrette,
whose costume ran through the whole gamut from white to rose-colour. Her
skirt was of a darker, her bodice of a brighter red, and a light rose-coloured
stocking peeped from beneath a grey silk petticoat; over her shoulders lay
a white swansdown cape, and white gloves and white silk shoes with rose-coloured
bows completed her toilette. His greatest picture represented
&ldquo;The End of a Masked Ball.&rdquo; Before the Paris Opera cabs are waiting with
coachmen sleeping or smoking, whilst a troop of pierrots and pierrettes,
harlequins, Japanese girls, <i>rococo</i> gentlemen, and Turkish women are streaming
out, sparkling with the most glittering colours in the grey light of a winter
morning, in which the gas lamps cast a warm yellow glimmer.</p>

<p>Even those who made their chief success as historical painters became
new beings when they came forward with such piquant &ldquo;little paintings.&rdquo;
<i>Francisco Domingo</i> in Valencia is the Spanish Meissonier, who has painted
little horsemen before an inn, mercenary soldiers, newspaper readers, and philosophers
of the time of Louis <span class="sc">XV</span>, with all the daintiness in colour associated
with the French patriarch&mdash;although a huge canvas, &ldquo;The Last Day of Sagunt,&rdquo;
has the reputation of being his chief performance. In the year in which he
exhibited his &ldquo;Vision in the Colosseum,&rdquo; <i>Benliure y Gil</i> made a success with
two little pictures stippled in varied colours, the &ldquo;Month of Mary&rdquo; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span>
the &ldquo;Distribution of Prizes in Valencia,&rdquo; in which children, smartened and
dressed in white frocks, are moving in the ante-chambers of a church, decorated
for the occasion. <i>Casado</i>, painter of the sanguinary tragedy of Huesca,
showed himself an admirable little master full of elegance and grace in &ldquo;The
Bull-Fighter&rsquo;s Reward,&rdquo; a small eighteenth-century picture. The master of
the great hospital picture, <i>Jimenez</i>, took the world by surprise at the very
same time by a &ldquo;Capuchin Friar&rsquo;s Sermon before the Cathedral of Seville,&rdquo;
which flashed with colour. <i>Emilio Sala y Francés</i>, whose historical masterpiece
was the &ldquo;Expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1493,&rdquo; delights elsewhere
in spring, Southern gardens with luxuriant vegetation, and delicate
<i>rococo</i> ladies, holding up their skirts filled with blooming roses, or gathering
wild flowers among the grass. <i>Antonio Fabrés</i> was led to the East by the
influence of Regnault, and excited attention by his aquarelles and studies
in pen and ink, in which he represented Oriental and Roman street figures
with astonishing adroitness. But the <i>ne plus ultra</i> is attained by the bold
and winning art of <i>Pradilla</i>, which is like a thing shot out of a pistol. He
is the greatest product of contemporary Spain, a man with a talent for improvisation
as ingenious as it was free, who treated with equal facility the
most varied subjects. In the bold and spirited decorations with which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>324</span>
embellished Spanish palaces he sported with nymphs and Loves and floating
genii <i>à la</i> Tiepolo. All the grace of the <i>rococo</i> period is cast over his works
in the Palais Murga in Madrid. The figures join each other with ease&mdash;coquettish
nymphs swaying upon boughs, and audacious &ldquo;Putti&rdquo; tumbling
over backwards in quaint games. Nowhere is there academic sobriety, and
everywhere life, pictorial inspiration, the intoxicating joyousness of a fancy
creating without effort and revelling in the festal delight of the senses. In
the accompanying wall pictures he revived the age of the troubadours, of
languishing love-song and knightly romance free from the burden of thought,
in tenderly graceful and fluent figures. And this same painter, who filled
these huge spaces of wall, lightly dallying with subjects from the world of
fable, seems another man when he grasps fragments from the life of our own
age in pithy inspirations sure in achievement. His historical pictures are
works which compel respect; but those paintings on the most diminutive
scale, in which he represented scenes from the Roman carnival and the life
in Spanish camps, the shore of the sea and the joy of a popular merry-making
with countless figures of the most intense vividness, carried out with an
unrivalled execution of detail which is yet free from anything laboured, and
full of splendour and glowing colour,&mdash;these, indeed, are performances of painting
beside which as a musical counterpart at best Paganini&rsquo;s variations
on the G string are comparable&mdash;sleights of art of which only Pradilla was
capable, and such as only Fortuny painted forty years ago.</p>

<p>Two masters who do not live at home, but in France, have followed still
further the modern development of art with great power. The first is
<i>Zuloaga</i>. The pictures of this artist have something truly Spanish, something
that one as an admirer of Goya looks for eagerly in Spanish pictures.
At the first glance the eye receives rather a shock. One seeks in vain for
delicate painting of light in Zuloaga, or exquisite harmonies of colour. He
places the crudest reds and yellows next to each other, strong, almost brutal,
like a poster. With an uncompromising love of truth he paints the rouge-smeared
cheeks and blackened eyebrows of his women-about-town, does
not even try to make their movements graceful or give their costumes a
touch of modish smartness. But what a breadth of conception! With what
daring he sweeps his bold strokes over the picture! It is just because he
avoids all flattery, because he brings nothing foreign, nothing cosmopolitan
into his exclusive world, that the characteristics of Spanish life are mirrored
with such truth in his works. Especially in his portrait of the popular poet,
Don Miguel de Segovia, the whole picture is suffused with a rare Don Quixote
feeling. Velasquez&rsquo; Pablillas stands before you reincarnated. It is interesting,
too, that Zuloaga, though in France, remains still a Spaniard. Even when
he paints Parisiennes he translates toilette and gesture into grandiose Spanish
style.</p>

<p>The influence of the French school is much more marked in the second
of these Spanish masters, <i>Hermen Anglada</i>. He has come to the front in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>325</span>
the exhibitions of the last few years. Besnard has given him much of his
refined epicurism, and this French <i>hautgoût</i> lends his pictures a charm
which is altogether their own. If you are seeking for unusual and quaint
effects you will find them in this Spaniard, who paints pale, colourless women
in the most astonishing costumes, places them in the midst of sensuous,
misty landscapes, and gives you a glistening potpourri of colours. But
Anglada&rsquo;s work is in itself the best testimony to the fact that the Spain of
to-day is getting worn-out and bloodless. There is something senile and
sapless in this over-refined art that takes pleasure in nothing but the most
extraordinary nuances, and that needs something very unusual to tickle its
nerves.</p>

<p class="center chap2">ITALY</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">Italy</span> has played a very different part from that of Spain in the development
of modern art. Even at the World Exhibition of 1855 Edmond
About called Italy &ldquo;the grave of painting&rdquo; in his <i>Voyage à travers l&rsquo;Exposition
des Beaux-Arts</i>. He mentions a few Piedmontese professors, but about
Florence, Naples, and Rome he found nothing to say. The Great Exhibition
of 1862 in England was productive of no more favourable criticism, for W.
Bürger&rsquo;s account is as little consolatory as About&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Renowned Italy
and proud Spain,&rdquo; writes Burger, &ldquo;have no longer any painters who can
rival those of other schools. There is nothing to be said about the rooms
where the Italians, Spanish, and Swiss are exhibited.&rdquo; To-day there are
in Italy a great number of vigorous painters. In Angelo de Gubernati&rsquo;s
lexicon of artists there are over two thousand names, some of which are
favourably known in other countries also. But the mass dwindles to a tiny
heap if those only are included who have risen from the level of dexterous
picture-makers to that of painters of real importance in the world of art.</p>

<p>Whether it be from direct influence or similarity of origin, Fortuny has
found his ablest successors amongst the Neapolitan artists. As early as the
seventeenth century the school of painting there was very different from
those in the rest of Italy; the Greek blood of the population and the wild,
romantic scenery of the Abruzzi gave it a peculiar stamp. Southern <i>brio</i>,
the joy of life, colour, and warmth, in contrast with the noble Roman ideal
of form, were the qualities of Salvator Rosa, Luca Giordano, and Ribera,
bold and fiery spirits. And a breath of such power seems to live in
their descendants still. Even now Neapolitan painting sings, dances, and
laughs in a bacchanal of colour, pleasure, delight in life, and glowing sunshine.</p>

<p>A wild and restless spirit, <i>Domenico Morelli</i>, whose biography is like a
chapter from <i>Rinaldo Rinaldini</i>, is the head of this Neapolitan school. He
was born on 4th August, 1826, and in his youth he is said to have been, first
a pupil in a seminary of priests, then an apprentice with a mechanician, and
for some time even <i>facchino</i>. He never saw such a thing as an academy.
Indeed, it was a Bohemian life that he led, making his meals of bread and
cheese, wandering for weeks together with Byron&rsquo;s poems in his pocket upon
the seashore between Posilippo and Baiæ. In 1848 he fought against King
Ferdinand, and was left severely wounded on the battle-field. After these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>327</span>
episodes of youth he first became a painter, beginning his career in 1855
with the large picture &ldquo;The Iconoclasts,&rdquo; followed in 1857 by a &ldquo;Tasso,&rdquo;
and in 1858 by a &ldquo;Saul and David.&rdquo; Biblical pictures remained his province
even later, and he was the only artist in Italy who handled these subjects
from an entirely novel point of view, pouring into them a peculiarly exalted
and imaginative spirit. A Madonna rocking her sleeping Child, whilst her
song is accompanied by a legion of cherubs playing upon instruments, &ldquo;The
Reviling of Christ,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ascension,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Descent from the Cross,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Christ walking on the Sea,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Raising of the Daughter of Jairus,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Expulsion of the Money-Changers from the Temple,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Marys
at the Grave,&rdquo; &ldquo;Salve Regina,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mary Magdalene meeting Christ risen
from the Grave,&rdquo; are the principal stages of his great Christian epic, and in
their imaginative naturalism a new revolutionary language finds utterance
through all these pictures. There is in them at times something of the mystical
quietude of the East, and at times something of the passionate breath of
Eugène Delacroix. In these pictures he revealed himself as a true child
of the land of the sun, a lover of painting which scintillates and flickers. As
yet hard, ponderous, dark, and plastic in &ldquo;The Iconoclasts,&rdquo; he was a worshipper
of light and resplendent in colour in the &ldquo;Mary Magdalene.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Temptation of St. Anthony&rdquo; probably marks the summit of his creative
power in the matter of colour. Morelli has conceived the whole temptation
as a hallucination. The saint squats upon the ground, claws with his fingers,
and with fixed gaze tries to stifle thoughts, full of craving sensuality, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>328</span>
are flaming in him. Yet they throng ever more thickly, take shape ever
more distinctly, are transformed into red-haired women who detach themselves
from corners upon all sides. They rise from beneath the matting,
wind nearer from the depth of the cavern; even the breeze that caresses
the fevered brow of the tormented man changes into the head of a girl pressing
her kisses upon him. Only Naples could produce an artist at once so bizarre,
so many-sided and incoherent, so opulent and strange. Younger men of
talent trooped around him. A fiery spirit, haughty and independent, he
became the teacher of all the younger generation. He led them to behold
the sun and the sea, to marvel at nature in her radiant brightness. Through
him the joy in light and colour came into Neapolitan painting, that rejoicing
in colour which touches such laughing concords in the works of his pupil
<i>Paolo Michetti</i>.</p>

<p>A man of bold and magnificent talent, the genuine product of the wild
Abruzzi, Michetti was the son of a day-labourer, like Morelli. However, a
man of position became the protector of the boy, who was early left an orphan.
But neither at the Academy at Naples nor in Paris and London did this
continue long. As early as 1876 he was back in Naples, and settled amid
the Abruzzi, close to the Adriatic, in Francavilla à Mare, near Ostona, a
little nest which the traveller passes just before he goes on board the Oriental
steamer at Brindisi. Here he lives out of touch with old pictures, in the
thick of the vigorous life of the Italian people. In 1877 he painted the work
which laid the foundation of his celebrity, &ldquo;The Corpus Domini Procession
at Chieti,&rdquo; a picture which rose like a firework in its boisterous, exhilarating
medley of bright colours. The procession is seen just coming out of church:
men, women, naked children, monks, priests, a canopy, choristers with censers,
old men and youths, people who kneel and people who laugh, the mist of
incense, the beams of the sun, flowers scattered on the ground, a band of
musicians, and a church façade with rich and many-coloured ornaments.
There is the play of variously hued silk, and colours sparkle in all the tints
of the prism. Everything laughs, the faces and the costumes, the flowers
and the sunbeams. Following upon this came a picture which he called
&ldquo;Spring and the Loves.&rdquo; It represented a desolate promontory in the
blue sea, and upon it a troop of Cupids, playing round a hawthorn bush in
full flower, are scuffling, buffeting each other, and leaping as riotously as
Neapolitan street-boys. Some were arrayed like little Japanese, some like
Grecian terra-cotta figures, whilst a marble bridge in the neighbourhood
shone in indigo blue. The whole picture gleamed with red, blue, green, and
yellow patches of colour: a serpentine dance painted twelve years before
the appearance of Loie Fuller. Then again he painted the sea. It is noon,
and the sultry heat broods over the azure tide. Naked fishermen are standing
in it, and on the shore gaily dressed women are searching for mussels; whilst,
in the background, vessels with the sun playing on their sails are mirrored
brightly in the water. Or the moon rises casting greenish reflections upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>329</span>
the body of Christ, which shines like phosphorus as it is being taken from
the cross: or there is a flowery landscape upon a summer evening; birds
are settling down for the night, and little angels are kissing each other and
laughing. In all these pictures Michetti showed himself an improviser of
astonishing dexterity, solving every difficulty as though it were child&rsquo;s play,
and shedding a brilliant colour over everything&mdash;a man to whom &ldquo;painting&rdquo;
was as much a matter of course as orthography is to ourselves. Even the
Paris World Exhibition of 1878 made him celebrated as an artist, and from
that time his name was to the Italian ear a symbol for something new, unexpected,
wild, and extravagant. The word &ldquo;Michetti&rdquo; means splendid
materials, dazzling flesh-tones, conflicting hues set with intention beside
each other, the luxuriant bodies of women basking in heat and sun, fantastic
landscapes created in the mad brain of the artist, strange and curious frames,
and village idylls in the glowing blaze of the sun. There are no lifeless spots
in his works; every whim of his takes shape, as if by sorcery, in splendid
figures.</p>

<p>Another pupil of Morelli, <i>Edoardo Dalbono</i>, completed his duty to history
by a scene of horror <i>à la</i> Laurens, &ldquo;The Excommunication of King Manfred,&rdquo;
and then became the painter of the Bay of Naples. &ldquo;The Isle of Sirens&rdquo;
was the first production of his able, appetising, and nervously vibrating
brush. There is a steep cliff dropping sheer into the blue sea. Two antique
craft are drawing near, the crews taking no heed of the reefs and sandbanks.
With phantomlike gesture the naked women stretch out their arms beckoning,
embodiments as they are of the deadly beautiful and voluptuously cruel
ocean. By degrees the sea betrayed to him all its secrets&mdash;its strangest
combinations of colour and atmospheric effects, its transparency, and its
eternally shifting phases of ebb and flow. He has painted the Bay of Naples
under bright, hot noon and the gloom of night, in the purple light of the
sinking sun and in the strange and many-coloured mood of twilight. At
one moment it shines and plays variegated and joyous in blue, grass-green,
and violet tones; at another it seems to glitter with millions of phosphorescent
sparks: the rosy clouds of the sky are glassed in it, and the lights of the houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>330</span>
irregularly dotted over abrupt mountain-chains or the dark-red glow of lava
luridly shining from Vesuvius. Now and then he painted scenes from Neapolitan
street-life&mdash;old, weather-beaten seamen, young sailors with features
as sharply cut as if cast in bronze, beautiful, fiery, brown women, shooting
the hot Southern flame from their eyes, houses painted white or orange-yellow,
with the sun glittering on the windows. The &ldquo;Voto alla Madonna
del Carmine&rdquo; was the most comprehensive of these Southern pictures.
Everything shines in joyous blue, yellowish-green, and red colours. Warmth,
life, light, brilliancy, and laughter are the elements on which his art is based.</p>

<p><i>Alceste Campriani</i>, <i>Giacomo di Chirico</i>, <i>Rubens Santoro</i>, <i>Federigo Cortese</i>,
<i>Francesco Netti</i>, <i>Edoardo Toffano</i>, <i>Giuseppe de Nigris</i> have, all of them, this
kaleidoscopic sparkle, this method
of painting which gives pictures the
appearance of being mosaics of
precious stones. As in the days
of the Renaissance, the Church is
usually the scene of action, though
not any longer as the house of God,
but as the background of a many-coloured
throng. As a rule these
pictures contain a crowd of canopies,
priests, and choristers, and country-folk,
bowing or kneeling when the
host is carried by, or weddings, horse-races,
and country festivals; and
everything is vivid and joyous in
colour, saturated with the glowing
sun of Naples. Alceste Campriani&rsquo;s
chief work was entitled &ldquo;The Return
from Montevergine.&rdquo; Carriages and
open rack-waggons are dashing along,
the horses snorting and the drivers
smacking their whips, while the
peasants, who have had their fill of
sweet wine, are shouting and singing,
and the orange-sellers in the street
are crying their goods. A coquettish
glancing light plays over the gay
costumes, and the white dust sparkles
like fluid silver, as it rises beneath
the hoofs of the horses wildly plunging
forward. The leading work of

in 1883, was &ldquo;A Wedding in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>331</span>
Basilicata.&rdquo; It represents a motley crowd. The entire village has set
out to see the ceremony. The wedding guests are descending the church
steps to the square, which is decked out with coloured carpets and strewn
with flowers. Triumphal arches have been set up, and the pictures of
the Madonna are hung with garlands. Meanwhile the <i>sindaco</i> gives his
arm to the bride, beneath whose gay costume a charmingly graceful little
foot is peeping out. Then the bridegroom follows with the <i>sindaco&rsquo;s</i> wife.
All the village girls are looking on with curiosity, and the musicians are
playing. Winter has covered the square with a white cloak of snow; yet the
sunbeams sport over it, making it shine vividly with a thousand reflections.</p>

<p>Of course, the derivation of all these pictures is easily recognisable. Almost
all the Neapolitan painters studied at Fortuny&rsquo;s in the seventies in Rome,
and when they came home again they perceived that the life of the people
offered themes which had a coquettish fitness in Fortuny&rsquo;s scale of tones.
From the variously coloured magnificence of old churches, the red robes of
ecclesiastics, the gaudy splendour of the country-people&rsquo;s clothes, and the
gay glory of rags amongst the Neapolitan children, they composed a modern
<i>rococo</i>, rejoicing in colour, whilst the Spaniard had fled to the past to attain
his gleaming effects.</p>

<p>A great number of the Italians do the same even now. In numerous
costume pictures, from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, flashing
with silk and velvet, the Southerner&rsquo;s bright pleasure in colour still loves
to celebrate its orgies. Gay trains rustle, rosy Loves laugh down from the
walls, Venetian chandeliers shed their radiance; no other epoch in history
enables the painter with so much ease to produce such an efflorescence of
full-toned chords of colour. With his shining glow of hue the delectable
and spirited <i>Favretto</i> (who, like Fortuny, entered the world of art as a victor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>332</span>
and, like him again, was snatched from it when barely thirty-seven, after a
brief and brilliant career) stands at the head of this group. The child of
poor parents, indeed the son of a joiner, he was born in Venice in 1849, and,
like the Spaniard, passed a youth which was full of privations. But all the
cares of existence, even the loss of an eye, did not hinder him from seeing
objects under a laughing brightness of colour. Through his studies and the
bent of his fancy he had come to be no less at home in the Venice of the
eighteenth century than in that of his own time. This Venice of Francesco
Guardi, this city of enchantment surrounded with the gleam of olden splendour,
the scene of rich and brilliantly coloured banquets and a graceful and modish
society, rose once more under Favretto&rsquo;s hands in fabulous beauty. What
<i>brio</i> of technique, what harmony of colours, were to be found in the picture
&ldquo;Un Incontro,&rdquo; the charming scene upon the Rialto Bridge, with the bowing
cavalier and the lady coquettishly making her acknowledgments! This was
the first picture which gave him a name in the world. What fanfares of
colour were in the two next pictures, &ldquo;Banco Lotto&rdquo; and &ldquo;Erbajuolo
Veneziano&rdquo;! At the Exhibition in Turin in 1883 he was represented by
&ldquo;The Bath&rdquo; and &ldquo;Susanna and the Elders&rdquo;; at that in Venice in 1887 he
celebrated his last and greatest triumph. The three pictures &ldquo;The Friday
Market upon the Rialto Bridge,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Canal Ferry near Santa Margherita,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;On the Piazzetta&rdquo; were the subject of enthusiastic admiration. All
the Venetian society of the age of Goldoni, Gozzi, and Casanova had become
vivid in this last picture, and moved over the smooth brick pavement of the
Piazzetta at the hour of the promenade, from the Doge&rsquo;s palace to the library,
and from the Square of St. Mark to the pillar of the lions and Theodore, to
and fro in surging life. Men put up their glasses and chivalrously greeted
the queens of beauty. The enchanting magic building of Sansovino, the
<i>loggetta</i> with their bright marble pillars, bronze statues of blackish-grey, and
magnificent lattice doors, formed the background of the standing and sauntering
groups, whose variegated costumes united with the tones of marble and
bronze to make a most beautiful combination of colours. Favretto had a
manner of his own, and, although a member of the school of Fortuny, he
was stronger and healthier than the latter. He drew like a genuine painter,
without having too much of the Fortuny fireworks. His soft, rich painting
was that of a colourist of distinction, always tasteful, exquisite in tone, and
light and pleasing in technique.</p>

<p>By the other Italian costume painters the scale run through by Fortuny
was not enriched by new notes. Most of their pictures are nugatory, coquettishly
sportive toys, masterly in technique no doubt, but so empty of substance
that they vanish from memory like novels read upon a railway journey.
Many have no greater import than dresses, cloaks, and hats worn by ladies
during a few weeks of the season. Sometimes their significance is not even
so great, since there are modistes and dressmakers who have more skill in
making ruches and giving the right <i>nuance</i> to colours. Some small part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>333</span>
Favretto&rsquo;s refined taste seems to have been communicated to the Venetian
<i>Antonio Lonza</i>, who delights in mingling the gleaming splendour of Oriental
carpets, fans, and screens amid the motley, picturesque costumes of the
<i>rococo</i> period&mdash;Japanese who perform as jugglers and knife-throwers in
quaint <i>rococo</i> gardens before the old Venetian nobility. But the centre
of this costume painting is Florence, and the great mart for it the <i>Società
artistica</i>, where there are yearly exhibitions.</p>

<p>Francesco Vinea, Tito Conti, Federigo Andreotti, and Edoardo Gelli are
in Italy the special manufacturers who have devoted themselves, with the
assistance of Meissonier, Gérôme, and Fortuny, to scenes from the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, to plumed hats, Wallenstein boots, and horsemen&rsquo;s
capes, to Renaissance lords and laughing Renaissance ladies, and
they have thereby won great recognition in Germany. Pretty, languishing
women in richly coloured costumes, tippling soldiers and gallant cavaliers,
laughing peasant women and trim serving-girls drawing wine in the cellar
vaults and setting it before a trooper, who in gratitude affectionately puts
his arm round their waist, beautiful and still more languishing noble ladies,
who laugh with a parrot or a dog, instead of a trooper, in apartments richly
furnished with Gobelins&mdash;such for the most part are the subjects treated
by <i>Francesco Vinea</i> with great virtuosity bordering on the routine of a typewriter.
His technique is neither refined nor fascinating; the colours are so
crude that they affect the eye as a false note the ear. But the mechanical
power of his painting is great. He has much ability, far more, indeed, than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>334</span>
Sichel, and possesses the secret of painting, in an astonishing manner, the
famous lace kerchiefs wound round the heads of his fair ones. <i>Andreotti</i>
and <i>Tito Conti</i> work in the same fashion, except that the ballad-singers and
rustic idylls of Andreotti are the smoother and more mawkish, whereas the
pictures of Conti make a somewhat more refined and artistic effect. His
colour is superior and more transparent, and his tapestry backgrounds are
warmer.</p>

<p>And, so far as one can judge from their pictures, life runs as merrily for
the Italians of the present as it did for those <i>rococo</i> cavaliers. Hanging
here and there beside the serious art of other nations, these little picture-people
enjoy their careless tinsel pomp; art is a gay thing for them, as gay
as a Sunday afternoon with a procession and fireworks, walks and sips of
sherbet, to an Italian woman. By the side of the blue-plush and red-velvet
costume-picture comic <i>genre</i> still holds its sway: barbaric in colour and
with materials which are merrier than is appropriate in tasteful pictures,
<i>Gaetano Chierici</i> represents children, both good and naughty, making their
appearance upon a tiny theatre. <i>Antonio Rotta</i> renders comic episodes from
the life of Venetian cobblers and the menders of nets. <i>Scipione Vannuttelli</i>
paints young girls in white dresses arrayed as nuns or being confirmed in
church. <i>Francesco Monteverde</i> rejoices in comical <i>intermezzi</i> in the style of
Grützner&mdash;for instance, an ecclesiastical gentleman observing, to his horror,
that his pretty young servant-girl is being kissed by a smart lad in the yard.
This is more or less his style of subject. <i>Ettore Tito</i> paints the pretty Venetian
laundresses whom Passini, Cecil van Haanen, Charles Ulrich, Eugène Blaas,
and others introduced into art. Only a very few struck deeper notes. <i>Luigi
Nono</i>, in Venice, painted his beautiful picture &ldquo;Refugium Peccatorum&rdquo;;
<i>Ferragutti</i>, the Milanese, his &ldquo;Workers in the Turnip Field,&rdquo; a vivid study
of sunlight of serious veracity; and after these <i>Giovanni Segantini</i> came
forward with his forcible creations, in which he has demonstrated that it is
possible for a man to be an Italian and yet a serious artist.</p>

<p>Segantini&rsquo;s biography is like a novel. Born the child of poor parents,
in Arco, in 1858, he was left, after the death of his parents, to the care of
a relative in Milan with whom he passed a most unhappy time. He then
wanted to make his fortune in France, and set out upon foot; but he did
not get very far, in fact he managed to hire himself out as a swine-herd. After
this he lived for a whole year alone in the wild mountains, worked in the field,
the stable, the barn. Then came the well-known discovery, which one could
not believe were it not to be read in Gubernati. One day he drew the finest
of his pigs with a piece of charcoal upon a mass of rock. The peasants ran
in a crowd and took the block of stone, together with the young Giotto, in
triumph to the village. He was given assistance, visited the School of Art
in Milan, and now paints the things he did in his youth. In a secluded village
of the Alps, Val d&rsquo;Albola in Switzerland, a thousand metres above the sea,
amid the grand and lofty mountains, he settled down, surrounded only by
the peasants who make a precarious living from the soil. Out of touch with
the world of artists the whole year round, observing great nature at every
season and every hour of the day, fresh and straightforward in character,
he is one of those natures of the type of Millet, in whom heart and hand,
man and artist, are one and the same thing. His shepherd and peasant
scenes from the valleys of the high Alps are free from all flavour of <i>genre</i>.
The life of these poor and humble beings passes without contrasts and passions,
being spent altogether in work, which fills the long course of the day in monotonous
regularity. The sky sparkles with a sharp brilliancy. The spiky
yellow and tender green of the fields forces its way modestly from the rocky
ground. In front is something like a hedge where a cow is grazing, or there
is a shepherdess pasturing her sheep. Something majestic there is in this
cold nature, where the sunshine is so sharp, the air so thin. And the primitive,
it might almost be said antique, execution of these pictures is in accord with
the primitive simplicity of the subjects. In fact, Segantini&rsquo;s pictures, with
their cold silvery colours, and their contours so sharp in outline, standing
out hard against the rarefied air, make an impression like encaustic paintings
or mosaics. They have nothing alluring or pleasing, and there is,
perhaps, even a touch of mannerism in this mosaic painting; but they are
nevertheless exceedingly true, rugged, austere, and yet sunny. Segantini
opened up to painting an entirely new world of beauty, the poetry of the
highlands. His appearance dates from the Impressionistic period when
preference was given to damp, misty atmospheres which toned down all
colour and melted away all lines, and artists made a specialty of flat, monotonous
plains. At that time the mountains were in bad repute, thanks to the
old-fashioned painters of views, the masters of the &ldquo;picture-postcard style.&rdquo;
Segantini led the way again up to the heights; but he did not paint the
mountain-tops that, like the Titans of old, strive to reach the sky; he painted
the plateaus, not the plains of the lowlands, but of the highlands, lonely,
weird, sublime, where man draws near to the heart of Nature, far from the
noise and struggle of everyday life. The air of the heights is there, the colours
and lines speak with no uncertain voice. Thus Segantini learnt from the
locale of his pictures to become the first master of line among the Impressionists.
How he mirrors in his pictures the stillness, the might and grandeur of these
lofty heights! With what astounding truth his cold, clear colours make
us feel the coldness and clearness of these regions. Like a dome of steel, the
sky stretches over the steel-blue lakes, clear as crystal, over the pale-green
meadows in the grip of the frost; the tender foliage rustles and freezes in the
quivering ice-cold air: there glaciers gleam, there glitters the snow, there
the sun pours down his beams upon the earth like plumes of fire. A thunder
cloud draws near, calm and majestic as destiny in its relentless course. There
is something Northern and virginal, something earnest and grandiose, which
stands in strange contrast with the joyful, conventional smile which is
otherwise spread over the countenance of Italian painting. Though he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>338</span>
died so young, Giovanni Segantini will live for all time in the history of
art.</p>

<p>With the exception of Segantini, not one of these painters will own that
there are poverty-stricken and miserable people in his native land. An
everlasting blue sky still laughs over Italy, sunshine and the joy of life still
hold undisputed sway over Italian pictures. There is no work in sunny
Italy, and in spite of that there is no hunger. Even where work is being
done there are assembled only the fairest girls of Lombardy, who kneel
laughing and jesting on the strand, while the wind dallies with their clothes.
They have a special delight for showing themselves while engaged at their
toilette, in a bodice, their little feet in neat little slippers, their naked arms
raised to arrange their red-gold hair. As a rule, however, they do nothing
whatever but smile at you with their most seductive smile, which shows
their pearl-white teeth, and ensnares every poor devil who does not suspect
that they have smiled for years in the same way, and most of all with him
who pays highest: &ldquo;<i>j&rsquo;aime les hommes parse que j&rsquo;aime les truffes</i>.&rdquo; These
pictures are almost invariably works which are well able to give pleasure
to their possessor, only they seldom suggest discussion on the course of art.
<i>Trop de marchandise</i> is the phrase generally used in the Paris Salon when
the Italians come under consideration. Few there are amongst them who
are real pioneers, spirits pressing seriously forward and having a quickening
influence on others. The vital questions of the painting of free light, Impressionism,
and Naturalism do not interest them in the least. A naïve,
pleasant, lively, and self-complacent technique is in most cases the solitary
charm of their works. One feels scarcely any inclination to search the catalogue
for the painter&rsquo;s name, and whether the beauty&mdash;for she is not the first
of her kind&mdash;who was called Ninetta last year has now become Lisa. Most
of these modern Italians execute their pictures in the way in which gold
pieces are minted, or in the way in which plastic works, which run through
so many editions, are produced in Italy. Nowhere are more beautiful laces
chiselled, and in the same manner painters render the shining splendour of
satin and velvet, the glittering brilliancy of ornaments, and the starry radiance
of the beautiful eyes of women. Only, as soon as one has once seen
them one knows the pictures by heart, as one knows the works in marble,
and this is so because the painters had them by heart first. Everywhere
there are the evidences of talent, industry, ability, and spirit, but there is
no soul in the spirit and no life in the colours. So many brilliant tones stand
beside each other, and yet there is neither a refined tone nor the impression
of truth to nature.</p>

<p>In all this art of theirs there is scarcely a question of any serious landscape.
Apart from the works of some of the younger men&mdash;for instance,
<i>Belloni</i>, <i>Serra</i>, <i>Gola</i>, <i>Filippini</i>, and others, who display an intimacy of observation
which is worthy of honour&mdash;a really close connection with the efforts
made across the Alps is not achieved in these days. As a rule the landscapes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>339</span>
are mere products of handicraft, which are striking for the moment by their
technical routine, but seldom waken any finer feelings, whether the Milanese
paint the dazzling Alpine effects or the Venetian lagunes steeped in light,
with gondolas and gondola-poles glowing in the sunshine, or the Neapolitans
set glittering upon the canvas their beautiful bay like a brilliant firework.
Most of them continue to pursue with complete self-satisfaction the flagged
gondola of Ziem; the conquests of the Fontainebleau painters and of the
Impressionists are unnoticed by them.</p>

<p>And this industrial characteristic of Italian painting is sufficiently explained
by the entire character of the country. The Italian painter is not
properly in a position to seek effects of his own and to make experiments.
Hardly anything is bought for the galleries, and there are few collectors of
superior taste. He labours chiefly for the traveller, and this gives his performances
the stamp of attractive mercantile wares. The Italian is too
much a man of business to undertake great trials of strength <i>pour le roi de
Prusse</i>. He paints no great pictures, which would be still-born children in
his home, nor does he paint severe studies of <i>plein-air</i>, preferring a specious,
exuberant, flickering, and glaring revel in colour. In general he produces
nothing which will not easily sell, and has a fine instinct for the taste of the
rich travelling public, who wish to see nothing which does not excite cheerful
and superficial emotions.</p>

<p>But it is possible that this decline of the Latin races is connected with the
nature of modern art itself. Of late the words &ldquo;Germanic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Latin&rdquo;
have been much abused. It has been proclaimed that the new art meant
the victory of the German depth of feeling over the Latin sense of form, the
onset of German cordiality against the empty exaggeration in which the
imitation of the Cinquecento resulted. Such assertions are always hard to
maintain, because every century shows similar reactions of truth to nature
against mannerism. Nevertheless is it true that modern art, with its heartfelt
devotion to everyday life and the mysteries of light, has an essentially
Germanic character, finding its ancestors not in Raphael, Michael Angelo,
and Titian, but in the English of the eighteenth, the Dutch of the seventeenth,
and the Germans of the sixteenth century. The Italians and Spaniards,
whose entire intellectual culture rests upon a Latin foundation, may therefore
find it difficult to follow this change of taste. They either adhere to the old
bombastic and theatrical painting of history, or they recast the new painting
in an external drawing-room art draped with gaudy tinsel. Even in France
the rise of the new art meant, as it were, the victory of the Frankish element
over the Gallic. Millet the Norman, Courbet the Frank, Bastien-Lepage
of Lorraine, drove back the Latins&mdash;Ingres and Couture, Cabanel and Bouguereau&mdash;just
as in the eighteenth century the Netherlander Watteau broke
the yoke of the rigid Latin Classicism.</p>

<p>It is perhaps no mere chance that the threads of the Germanic aim in art
were drawn out with such zeal by the Germanic nations. With the Latins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>340</span>
a striking effect is made by brilliant technique, mastery of the manual art of
painting, and careless sway over all the enchantments of the craft; with the
Teutons one stands in the presence of an art which is so natural and simple
that one scarcely thinks of the means by which it was called into being. In
one case there is virtuosity, ductility, and grace; in the other, health, intrinsic
feeling, and temperament.</p>

<p class="noind pt1"><span class="chap1 sc">To</span> English painting the acquisitions of the French could now give little
that was radically novel, for the epoch-making labours of the pre-Raphaelites
were already in existence. Apart from certain cases of
direct borrowing, it has either completely preserved its autonomy, or recast
everything assimilated from France in a specifically English fashion. It is
in art, indeed, as it is with men themselves. The English travel more than
any other people, for travel is a part of their education. They are to be met
in every quarter of the globe&mdash;in Africa, Asia, America, or the European
Continent; and they scarcely need to open their mouths, even from a distance,
to betray that they are English. In the same way there is no need of
a catalogue at exhibitions to recognise all English pictures at the first glance.
English painting is too English not to be fond of travel. The painter delights
in reconnoitring all other schools and studying all styles; he is as much at
home in the past as in the present. But as the English tourist, let him go to
the world&rsquo;s end, retains everywhere his own customs, tastes, and habits, so
English painting, even on its most adventurous journeys, remains unwaveringly
true to its national spirit, and returns from all its wanderings more
English than before; it adapts what is alien with the same delicious abnegation
of all scruple with which the English tongue brings foreign words into harmony
with its own sense of convenience. A certain softness of feeling and tenderness
of spirit induce the English even in these days to avoid hard contact with
reality. Their art rejects everything in nature which is harsh, rude, and
brutal; it is an art which polishes and renders the reality poetic at the risk
of debilitating its power. It considers matters from the standpoint of what
is pretty, touching, or intelligible, and by no means holds that everything
true is necessarily beautiful. And just as little does the English eye&mdash;so
much occupied with detail&mdash;see light in its most exquisite subtleties. Indeed,
it rather sees the isolated fact than the total harmony, and is clearer than it is
fine.</p>

<p>For this reason <i>plein-air</i> painting has very few adepts, and the atmospheric
influences which blunt the lines of objects, efface colours, and bring them
nearer to each other, meet with little consideration. Things are given all
the sharpness of their outlines, and the harmony, which in the French follows
naturally from the observation of light and air saturating form and colour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>342</span>
is the more artificially attained by everything being brought into concord
in a bright and delicate tone, which is almost too fine. The audacities of
Impressionism are excluded, because painting which starts from a masterly
seizure of total effect would seem too sketchy to English taste, which has been
formed by Ruskin. Painting must be highly finished and highly elaborated;
that is a <i>conditio sine qua non</i> which English taste refuses to renounce in oil-painting
as little as in water-colour, and in England they are more closely
related than elsewhere, and have mutually influenced each other in the
matter of technique. In fact, English water-colours seek to rival oil-painting
in force and precision, and have therefore forfeited the charm of improvisation,
the <i>verve</i> of the first sketch, and the freshness and ease which they should
have by their very character. Through a curious change of parts oil-painting
has a fancy for borrowing from water-colours their effects and their processes.
English pictures have no longer anything heavy or oily, but they likewise show
nothing of the manipulation of the brush, rather resembling large water-colours,
perhaps even pastels or wax-painting. The colours are chosen with
reserve, and everything is subdued and softened like the quiet step of the
footman in the mansion of a nobleman. The special quality in all English
pictures&mdash;putting aside a preference for bright yellow and vivid red in the
older period&mdash;consists in a bluish or greenish luminous general tone, to which
every English painter seems to conform as though it were a binding social
convention, and it even recurs in English landscapes. In fact, English painting
differs from French as England from France.</p>

<p>France is a great city, and the name of this city is Paris. Here, and not in
the provinces, lives that fashionable, thinking world which has become the
guide of the nation and the censor of beauty, by the refinement of its taste
and its preeminent intellect. The ideas which fly throughout the land upon
invisible wires are born in Paris. Painting, likewise, receives them at first
hand. It stands amid the seething whirlpool of the age, the heart&rsquo;s-blood
of the present streams through all its veins, and there is nothing human
that is alien to it, neither the filth nor the splendour of life, its laughter nor
its misery. All the nerves of the great city are vibrating in it. Paris has
made her people refined and, at the same time, insatiate in enjoyment. Every
day they have need of new impressions and new theories to ward off tedium.
And thus is explained the universally comprehensive sphere of subject in
French painting, and its feverish versatility in technique.</p>

<p>But London has, in no sense, the importance for England which Paris has
for France. It is a centre of attraction for business; but the more refined
classes of society live in the country. As soon as one is off in the Dover express
country houses fly past on either side of the train. They are all over England&mdash;upon
the shores of the lakes, upon the strand of the sea, upon the tops of the
hills. And how pleasant they are, how well appointed, how delightful to
look at, with their gabled roofs and their gleaming brickwork overgrown with
ivy! Around them stretches a fresh lawn which is rolled every morning, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>343</span>
soft as velvet. Fat oxen,
and sheep as white as if they
had been just washed, lie
upon the grass. Thus all
rustic England is like a great
summer resort, where there
is heard no sound of the
ringing and throbbing strokes
of life. Nor is painting allowed
to disturb this idyllic
harmony. No one wishes
that anything should remind
him of the prose of life when
his work is done and the
town has vanished. Schiller&rsquo;s
assertion, &ldquo;Life is earnest,
blithe is art,&rdquo; is here the
first law of æesthetics.</p>

<p>English painting is exclusively
an art based on
luxury, optimism, and aristocracy;
in its neatness,
cleanliness, and good-breeding
it is exclusively designed
to ingratiate itself with
English ideas of comfort.
Yet the pictures have to satisfy very different tastes&mdash;the taste of a wealthy
middle class which wishes to have substantial nourishment, and the æesthetic
taste of an <i>élite</i> class, which will only tolerate the quintessence of art, the
most subtle art that can be given. But all these works are not created for
galleries, but for the drawing-room of a private house, and in subject and
treatment they have all to reckon with the ascendant view that a picture
ought, in the first place, to be an attractive article of furniture for the sitting-room.
The traveller, the lover of antiquity, is pleased by imitation of the
ancient style; the sportsman, the lover of country life, has a delight in little
rustic scenes; and the women are enchanted with feminine types. And
everything must be kept within the bounds of what is charming, temperate,
and prosperous, without in any degree suggesting the struggle for existence.
The pictures have themselves the grace of that mundane refinement from the
midst of which they are beheld.</p>

<p>England is the country of the sculptures of the Parthenon, the country
where Bulwer Lytton wrote his <i>Last Days of Pompeii</i>, and where the most
Grecian female figures in the world may be seen to move. Thus painters of
antique subjects still play an important part in the pursuit of English art&mdash;probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span>
the pursuit of art rather than its development. For they have
never enriched the treasury of modern sentiment. Trained, all of them, in
Paris or Belgium, they are equipped with finer taste, and have acquired abroad
a more solid ability than James Barry, Haydon, and Hinton, the half-barbaric
English Classicists of the beginning of the century. But at bottom&mdash;like
Cabanel and Bouguereau&mdash;they represent rigid conservatism in opposition to
progress, and the way in which they set about the reconstruction of an august
or domestic antiquity is only distinguished by an English <i>nuance</i> of race from
that of Couture and Gérôme.</p>

<p><i>Lord Leighton</i>, the late highly cultured President of the Royal Academy,
was the most dignified representative of this tendency. He was a Classicist
through and through&mdash;in the balance of composition, the rhythmical flow
of lines, and the confession of faith that the highest aim of art is the representation
of men and women of immaculate build. In the picture galleries
of Paris, Rome, Dresden, and Berlin he received his youthful impressions;
his artistic discipline he received under Zanetti in Florence, under Wiertz
and Gallait in Brussels, under Steinle in Frankfort, and under Ingres and Ary
Scheffer in Paris. Back in England once more, he translated Couture into
English as Anselm Feuerbach translated him into German with greater independence.
Undoubtedly there has never been anything upon his canvas
which could be supposed ungentlemanlike. And as a nation is usually apt
to prize most the very thing which has been denied it, and for which it has no
talent, Leighton was soon an object of admiration to the refined world. As
early as 1864 he became an associate, and in November 1879 President of the
Royal Academy. For sixteen years he sat like a Jupiter upon his throne in
London. An accomplished man of the world and a good speaker, a scholar
who spoke many languages and had seen many countries, he possessed every
quality which the president of an academy needs to have; he had an exceedingly
imposing presence in his red gown, and did the honours of his house
with admirable tact.</p>

<p>But one stands before his works with a certain feeling of indifference.
There are few artists with so little temperament as Lord Leighton, few in
the same degree wanting in the magic of individuality. The purest academical
art, as the phrase is understood of Ingres, together with academical severity
of form, is united with a softness of feeling recalling Hofmann of Dresden;
and the result is a placid classicality adapted <i>ad usum Delphini</i>, a classicality
foregoing the applause of artists, but all the more in accordance with the
taste of a refined circle of ladies. His chief works, &ldquo;The Star of Bethlehem,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Orpheus and Eurydice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jonathan&rsquo;s Token to David,&rdquo; &ldquo;Electra at the
Tomb of Agamemnon,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Daphnephoria,&rdquo; &ldquo;Venus disrobing for the
Bath,&rdquo; and the like, are amongst the most refined although the most frigid
creations of contemporary English art.</p>

<p>Perhaps the &ldquo;Captive Andromache&rdquo; of 1888 is the quintessence of what
he aimed at. The background is the court of an ancient palace, where female
slaves are gathered together
fetching water. In the centre
of the stage, as the leading
actress, stands Andromache,
who has placed her pitcher
on the ground before her,
and waits with dignity until
the slaves have finished their
work. This business of water-drawing
has given Leighton
an opportunity for combining
an assemblage of beautiful
poses. The widow of Hector
expresses a queenly sorrow
with decorum, while the amphora-bearers
are standing
or walking hither and thither,
in the manner demanded by
the pictures upon Grecian
vases, but without that sureness
of line which comes of
the real observation of life.
In its dignity of style, in the
noble composition and purity
of the lines which circumscribe the forms with so much distinction and
in so impersonal a manner, the picture is an arid and measured work, cold
as marble and smooth as porcelain. &ldquo;Hercules wrestling with Death for
the Body of Alcestis&rdquo; might be a Grecian relief upon a sarcophagus, so
carefully balanced are the masses and the lines. The pose of Alcestis is
that of the nymphs of the Parthenon; only, it would not have been so fine
were these not in existence. His &ldquo;Music Lesson&rdquo; of 1877 is charming, and
his &ldquo;Elijah in the Wilderness&rdquo; is a work of style. And in his frescoes in
the South Kensington Museum there is a perfect compendium of beautiful
motives of gesture. The eye delights to linger over these feminine forms,
half nude, half enveloped with drapery, yet it notes, too, that these creations
are composed out of the painter&rsquo;s knowledge and artistic reminiscences;
there is a want of life in them, because the master has surrendered himself
to feeling with the organs of a dead Greek. Leighton&rsquo;s colour is always
carefully considered, scrupulously polished, and endowed with the utmost
finish, but it never has the magical charm by which one recognises the work
of a true colourist. It is rather the result of painstaking study and cultivated
taste than of personal feeling. The grace of form is always carefully prepared&mdash;a
thing which has the consciousness of its own existence. Beautiful and
spontaneous as the movements undoubtedly are, one has always a sense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>348</span>
that the artist is present, anxiously watching lest any of his actors offend
against a law of art.</p>

<p>Lord Leighton&rsquo;s pupils, Poynter and Prinsep, followed him with a good
deal of determination. <i>Val Prinsep</i> shares with Leighton the smooth forms
of a polished painting, whereas <i>Edward Poynter</i> by his more earnest severity
and metallic precision verges more on that union of aridness and style characteristic
of Ingres. His masterpiece, &ldquo;A Visit to Æsculapius,&rdquo; is in point of
technique one of the best products of English Classicism. To the left
Æsculapius is sitting beneath a pillared porch overgrown with foliage, while,
like Raphael&rsquo;s Jupiter in the Farnesina, he supports his bearded chin thoughtfully
with his left hand. A nymph who has hurt her foot appears, accompanied
by three companions, before the throne of the god, begging him for a remedy.
To say nothing of many other
nude or nobly draped female
figures, numerous decorative
paintings in the Houses of
Parliament, St. Paul&rsquo;s, and
St. Stephen&rsquo;s Church in Dulwich
owe their existence to
this most industrious artist.</p>

<p><i>Alma Tadema</i>, the famous
Dutchman who has called to
life amid the London fog the
sacrifices of Pompeii and Herculaneum,
stands to this grave
academical group as Gérôme
to Couture. As Bulwer Lytton,
in the field of literature,
created a picture of ancient
civilisation so successful that
it has not been surpassed by
his followers, Alma Tadema
has solved the problem of the
picture of antique manners in
the most authentic fashion in
the province of painting. He
has peopled the past, rebuilt
its towns and refurnished its
houses, rekindled the flame
upon the sacrificial altars and
awakened the echo of the
dithyrambs to new life.
Poynter tells old fables, while
Alma Tadema takes us in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>349</span>
company, and, like the best-informed
cicerone, leads us through the streets
of old Athens, reconstructing the
temples, altars, and dwellings, the
shops of the butchers, bakers, and
fishmongers, just as they once were.</p>

<p>This power of making himself believed
Alma Tadema owes in the first
place to his great archæological learning.
By Leys in Brussels this side of
his talent was first awakened, and in
1863, when he went to Italy for the
first time, he discovered his archæological
mission. How the old Romans
dressed, how their army was equipped
and attired, became as well known to
him as the appearance of the citizens&rsquo;
houses, the artizans&rsquo; workshops, the
market and the bath. He explored
the ruins of temples, and he grew
familiar with the privileges of the
priests, the method of worship, of the
sacrifices, and of the festal processions.
There was no monument of brass or
marble, no wall-painting, no pictured
vase nor mosaic, no sample of ancient
arts, of pottery, stone-cutting, or work
in gold, that he did not study. His
brain soon became a complete encyclopædia
of antiquity. He knew the
forms of architecture as well as he
knew the old myths, and all the
domestic appointments and robes as
exactly as the usages of ritual. In
Brussels, as early as the sixties, this
complete power of living in the period
he chose to represent gave Alma
Tadema&rsquo;s pictures from antiquity their
remarkable <i>cachet</i> of striking truthfulness
to life. And London, whither he
migrated in 1870, offered even a more
favourable soil for his art. Whereas
the French painters of the antique
picture of manners often fell into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span>
diluted idealism and a lifeless traffic with old curiosities, with Alma Tadema
one stands in the presence of a veritable fragment of life; he simply paints
the people amongst whom he lives and their world. The Pompeian house
which he has built in London, with its dreamy vividarium, its great golden hall,
its Egyptian decorations, its Ionic pillars, its mosaic floor, and its Oriental
carpets, contains everything one needs to conjure up the times of Nero and
the Byzantine emperors. It is surrounded by a garden in the old Roman
style, and a large conservatory adjoining is planted with plane-trees and
cypresses. All the celebrated marble benches and basins, the figures of
stone and bronze, the tiger-skins and antique vessels and garments of his
pictures, may be found in this notable house in the midst of London. Whether
he paints the baths, the amphitheatre, or the atrium, the scenes of his pictures
are no other than parts of his own house which he has faithfully painted.</p>

<p>And the figures moving in them are Englishwomen. Among all the
beautiful things in the world there are few so beautiful as English girls. Those
tall, slender, vigorous figures that one sees upon the beach at Brighton are
really like Greek women, and even the garb which they wear in playing tennis
is as free and graceful as that of the Grecian people. Alma Tadema was
able to introduce into his works these women of lofty and noble figure with
golden hair, these forms made for
sculpture&mdash;to use the phrase of
Winckelmann&mdash;without any kind of
beautifying idealism. In their still-life
his pictures are the fruit of
enormous archæological learning
which has become intuitive vision,
but his figures are the result of a
healthy rendering of life. In this
way the unrivalled classical local
colour of his interiors is to be explained,
as well as the lifelike character
of his figures. By his works a
remarkable problem is solved: an
intense feeling for modern reality
has called the ancient world into
being in a credible fashion, whilst it
has remained barricaded against all
others who have approached it by
the road of idealism.</p>

<p>It is only in this method of
execution that he still stands upon
the same ground as Gérôme, with
whom he shares a taste for anecdote,
and a pedantic, neat, and correct
style of painting. His ancient comedies played by English actors are an
excellent archæological lecture; they rise above the older picture of
antique manners by a more striking fidelity to nature, very different from
the generalisation of the Classicists&rsquo; ideal; yet as a painter he is wanting
in every quality. His marble shines, his bronze gleams, and everything
is harmonised with the green of the cypresses and delicate rose-colour of
the oleander blossoms in a cool marble tone; but there is also something
marble in the figures themselves. He draws and stipples, works like a copper
engraver, and goes over his work again and again with a fine and feeble brush.
His pictures have the effect of porcelain, his colours are hard and lifeless.
One remembers the anecdotes, but one cannot speak of any idea of colour.</p>

<p><i>Albert Moore</i> is to be noted as the solitary &ldquo;painter&rdquo; of the group: a
very delicate artist, with a style peculiar to himself; one who is not so well
known upon the Continent as he deserves to be. His province, also, is ancient
Greece, yet he never attempted to reconstruct classical antiquity as a learned
archæologist. Merely as a painter did he love to dream amid the imperishable
world of beauty known to ancient times. His figures are ethereal visions,
and move in dreamland. He was influenced, indeed, by the sculptures of
the Parthenon, but the Japanese have also penetrated his spirit. From
the Greeks he learnt the combination of noble lines, the charm of dignity
and quietude, while the Japanese gave him the feeling for harmonies of colour,
for soft, delicate, blended tones. By a capricious union of both these elements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>354</span>
he formed his refined and exquisite style. The world which he has called
into being is made up of white marble pillars; in its gardens are cool fountains
and marble pavements; but it is also full of white birds, soft colours, and
rosy blossoms from Kioto, and peopled with graceful and mysterious maidens,
clothed in ideal draperies, who love rest, enjoy an eternal youth, and are
altogether contented with themselves and with one another. It might be
said that the old figures of Tanagra had received new life, were it not felt,
at the same time, that these beings must have drunk a good deal of tea. Not
that they are entirely modern, for their figures are more plastic and symmetrical
than those of the actual daughters of Albion; but in all their movements
they have a certain <i>chic</i>, and in all their shades of expression a weary
modernity, through which they deviate from the conventional woman of
Classicism. Otherwise the pictures of Albert Moore are indescribable. Frail,
ethereal beings, blond as corn, lounge in æesthetically graduated grey and
blue, salmon-coloured, or pale purple draperies upon bright-hued couches
decorated by Japanese artists with most æsthetic materials; or are standing
in violet robes with white mantles embroidered with gold, by a grey-blue sea
which has a play of greenish tones where it breaks upon the shore. They
stand out with their rosy garments from the light grey background and the
delicate arabesques of a gleaming silvery gobelin, or in a graceful pose occupy
themselves with their rich draperies. They do as little as they possibly
can, but they are living and seductive, and the stuffs which they wear and
have around them are delicately and charmingly painted. It is harmonies
of tone and colour that exclusively form the subject of every work. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>355</span>
figures, accessories, and detail first take shape when the scheme of colour has
been found; and then Albert Moore takes a delight in naming his pictures
&ldquo;Apricots,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oranges,&rdquo; &ldquo;Shells,&rdquo; etc., according as the robes are apricot
or orange colour or adorned with light ornaments of shell. Everything
which comes from his hands is delightful in the charm of delicate simplicity,
and for any one who loves painting as painting it has something soothing
in the midst of the surrounding art, which still confuses painting with poetry
more than is fitting.</p>

<p>Such a painter-poet of the specifically English type is <i>Briton-Rivière</i>.
He is a painter of animals, and as such one of the greatest of the century.
Lions and geese, royal tigers and golden eagles, stags, dogs, foxes, Highland
cattle, he has painted them all, and with a mastery which has nothing like
it except in Landseer. Amongst the painters of animals he stands alone
through his power of conception and his fine poetic vein, while in all his
pictures he unites the greatest simplicity with enormous dramatic force.
Accessory work is everywhere kept within the narrowest limits, and everywhere
the character of the animals is magnificently grasped. He does not
alone paint great tragic scenes as Barye chiselled them, for he knows that
beasts of prey are usually quiet and peaceable, and only now and then obey
their savage nature. Moreover, he never attempts to represent animals
performing a masquerade of humanity in their gestures and expression, as
Landseer did, nor does he transform them into comic actors. He paints
them as what they are, a symbol of what humanity was once itself, with its
elemental passions and its natural virtues and failings. Amongst all animal
painters he is almost alone in resisting the temptation to give the lion a
consciousness of his own dignity, the tiger a consciousness of his own savageness,
the dog a consciousness of his own
understanding. They neither pose nor think
about themselves. In addition to this he
has a powerful and impressive method, and
a deep and earnest scheme of colour. In the
beginning of his career he learnt most from
James Ward. Later he felt the influence of
the refined, chivalrous, and piquant Scotchmen
Orchardson and Pettie. But the point
in which Briton-Rivière is altogether peculiar
is that in which he joins issue with the
painters influenced by Greece: he introduces
his animals into a scene where there are men
of the ancient world.</p>

<p>Briton-Rivière is descended from a
French family which found its way into
England after the revocation of the Edict
of Nantes, and he is one of those painters&mdash;so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>356</span>
frequent in English art&mdash;whose nature has developed early: when
he was fourteen he left school, exhibited in the Academy when he was
eighteen, painted as a pre-Raphaelite between the ages of eighteen and
twenty-two, and graduated at Oxford at seven-and-twenty. In his youth
he divided his time between art and scholarship&mdash;painting pictures and
studying Greek and Latin literature. Thus he became a painter of animals,
having also an enthusiasm for the Greek poets, and he has stood for a generation
as an uncontested lord and master on his own peculiar ground. In his first
important picture, of 1871, the comrades of Ulysses, changed into swine,
troop grunting round the enchantress Circe. In the masterpiece of 1872 the
Prophet Daniel stands unmoved and submissive to the will of God amid the
lions roaring and showing their teeth, ready to spring upon him in their hunger,
yet regarding him with a mysterious fear, spellbound by the power of his eye;
while his great picture &ldquo;Persepolis&rdquo; makes the appeal of a page from the
philosophy of history, with its lions roaming majestically amid the ruins of
human grandeur and human civilisation, which are flooded with moonlight.
The picture &ldquo;In Manus Tuas, Domine,&rdquo; showed St. George riding solitary
through the lonely and silent recesses of a primitive forest upon a pale white
horse. He is armed in mail and has a mighty sword; a deep seriousness is
imprinted on his features, for he has gone forth to slay the dragon. In yet
another picture, &ldquo;An Old-World Wanderer,&rdquo; a man of the early ages has
come ashore upon an untrodden
island, and is encompassed
by flocks of great
white birds, fluttering round
him with curiosity and confidence,
as yet ignorant of
the fear of human beings.
The picture of 1891, &ldquo;A
Mighty Hunter before the
Lord,&rdquo; is one of his most
poetic night-pieces: Nimrod
is returning home, and beneath
the silvery silence of
the moon the dead and dying
creatures which he has laid
low upon the wide Assyrian
plain are tended and bemoaned
by their mates.</p>

<p>Between whiles he painted
subjects which were not borrowed
from ancient history,
illustrating the friendship
between man and dog, as
Landseer had done before
him. For instance, in &ldquo;His
Only Friend&rdquo; there is a poor
lad who has broken down at
the last milestone before the
town and is guarded by his
dog. In &ldquo;Old Playfellows,&rdquo;
again, one of the playmates is
a child, who is sick and leans
back quietly in an armchair
covered with cushions. His
friend the great dog has one
paw resting on the child&rsquo;s
lap, and looks up with a
pensive expression, such as
Landseer alone had previously
painted. But in this style he
reached his highest point in
&ldquo;Sympathy.&rdquo; No work of
Briton-Rivière&rsquo;s has become
more popular than this picture
of the little maiden who

<p>Since the days of Reynolds English art has shown a most vivid originality
in such representations of children. English picture-books for children are
in these days the most beautiful in the world, and the marvellous fairy-tales
and fireside stories of <i>Randolph Caldecott</i> and <i>Kate Greenaway</i> have made their
way throughout the whole Continent. How well these English draughtsmen
know the secret of combining truth with the most exquisite grace! How
touching are these pretty babies, how angelically innocent these little maidens!
Frank eyes, blue as the flowers of the periwinkle, gaze at you with no thought
of their being looked at in return. The naïve astonishment of the little ones,
their frightened mien, their earnest look absently fixed upon the sky, the first
tottering steps of a tiny child and the mobile grace of a schoolgirl, all are
rendered in these prints with the most tender intimacy of feeling. And united
with this there is a delicate and entirely modern sentiment for scenery, for the
fascination of bare autumn landscapes robbed of their foliage, for sunbeams
and the budding fragrance of spring. Everything is idyllic, poetic, and
touched by a congenial breath of tender melancholy.</p>

<p>And this aerial quality, this delicacy and innocent grace and tenderness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>360</span>
is not confined alone to such representations of children, but is peculiar to
English painting. Even when perfectly ordinary subjects from modern life
are in question the basis of this art is, as in the first half of the century, by no
means the sense for what is purely pictorial, by no means that naturalistic
pantheism which inspires the modern French, but rather a sense for what is
moral or ethical. The painter seldom paints merely for the joy of painting,
and the numberless technical questions which play such an important part
in French art are here only of secondary importance. It accords with the
character and taste of the people that their artists have rather a poetic design
than one which is properly pictorial. The conception is sometimes allegorical
and subtle to the most exquisite fineness of point, sometimes it is vitiated
by sentimentality, but it is never purely naturalistic; and this qualified
realism, this realism with a poetic strain to keep it ladylike, set English art,
especially in the years when Bastien-Lepage and Roll were at their zenith,
in sharp opposition to the art
of France. In those days the
life-size artisan picture, the
prose of life, and the struggle
for existence reigned almost
exclusively in the Parisian
Salon, whereas in the Royal
Academy everything was quiet
and cordial; an intimate, inoffensive,
and heartfelt cheerfulness
was to be found in the
pictures upon its walls, as if
none of these painters knew
of the existence of such a
place as Whitechapel. A connection
between pictures and
poems is still popular, and
some touching trait, some
tender episode, some expression
of softness, is given to
subjects drawn from the ordinary
life of the people. Painters
seek in every direction after
pretty rustic scenes, moving
incidents, or pure emotions.
Instead of being harsh and
rugged in their sense of truth
and passion, they glide lightly
away from anything ugly,
bringing together the loveliest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>361</span>
and most beautiful things in nature, and creating elegies, pastorals, and
idylls from the passing events of life. Their method of expression is
fastidious and finished to a nicety; their vision of life is smiling and kindly,
though it must not be supposed that their optimism has now anything in
common with the <i>genre</i> picture of 1850. The <i>genre</i> painters from Wilkie to
Collins epitomised the actual manners of the present in prosaic compositions.
But here the most splendid poetry breaks out, as indeed it actually does in
the midst of ordinary life. If in that earlier period English painting was
awkward in narration, vulgar, and didactic, it is now tasteful, refined,
beautiful, and of distinction. The philistinism of the pictures of those days
has been finally stripped away, and the humorously anecdotic <i>genre</i> entirely
overcome. The generation of tiresome narrative artists has been followed
by painter-poets of delicacy and exquisite tenderness of feeling.</p>

<p>Two masters who died young and have a peculiarly captivating individuality,
George Mason and Fred Walker, stand at the head of this, the most
novel phase of English painting. Alike in the misfortune of premature
death, they are also united by a bond of sympathy in their taste and sentiment.
If there be truth in what Théophile Gautier once said in a beautiful
poem, &ldquo;<i>Tout passe, l&rsquo;art robuste seul a l&rsquo;éternité</i>,&rdquo; neither of them will enter
the kingdom of immortality. That might be applied to them which Heine
said of Leopold Robert: they have purified the peasant in the purgatory of
their art, so that nothing but a glorified body remains. As the pre-Raphaelites
wished to give exquisite precision to the world of dream, Walker and Mason
have taken this precision from the world of reality, endowing it with a refined
subtlety which in truth it does not possess. Their pictures breathe only of
the bloom and essence of things, and in them nature is deprived of her strength
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>362</span>
and marrow, and painting of her peculiar qualities, which are changed into
coloured breath and tinted dream. They may be reproached with an excess
of nervous sensibility, an effort after style by which modern truth is recast,
a morbid tendency towards suave mysticism. Nevertheless their works are
the most original products of English painting during the last thirty years,
and by a strange union of realism and poetic feeling they have exercised
a deeply penetrative influence upon Continental art.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Æquam semper in rebus arduis servare mentem</i>&rdquo; might be chosen as a
motto for <i>George Mason&rsquo;s</i> biography. Brought up in prosperous circumstances,
he first became a doctor, but when he was seven-and-twenty he
went to Italy to devote himself to painting; here he received the news that
he was ruined. His father had lost everything, and he found himself entirely
deprived of means, so that his life became a long struggle against hunger.
He bound himself to dealers, and provided animal pieces by the dozen for
the smallest sums. In a freezing room he sat with his pockets empty, worked
until it was dark, and crept into bed when Rome went to feast. After two
years, however, he had at last saved the money necessary for taking him
back to England, and he settled with his young wife in Wetley Abbey. This
little village, where he lived his simple life in the deepest seclusion, became
for him what Barbizon had been for Millet. He wandered by himself amongst
the fields, and painted the valleys of Wetley with the tenderness of feeling
with which Corot painted the outskirts of Fontainebleau. He saw the ghostly
mists lying upon the moors, saw the peasants returning from the plough
and the reapers from the field, noted the children, in their life so closely connected
with the change of nature. And yet his peasant pictures more resemble
the works of Perugino than those of Bastien-Lepage. The character of their
landscape is to some extent responsible for this. For the region he paints,
in its lyrical charm, has kinship with the hills in the pictures of Perugino.
Here there grow the same slender trees upon a delicate, undulating soil.
But the silent, peaceful, and resigned human beings who move across it have
also the tender melancholy of Umbrian Madonnas. Mason&rsquo;s realism is merely
specious; it consists in the external point of costume. There are really no
peasants of such slender growth, no English village maidens with such rosy
faces and such coquettish Holland caps. Mason divests them of all the
heaviness of earth, takes, as it were, only the flower-dust from reality. The
poetic grace of Jules Breton might be recalled, were it not that Mason works
with more refinement and subtlety, for his idealism was unconscious, and
never resulted in an empty, professional painting of beauty.</p>

<p>When he painted his finest pictures he suffered from very bad health,
and his works have themselves the witchery of disease, the fascinating beauty
of consumption. He painted with such delicacy and refinement, because
sickness had made him weak and delicate; he divested his peasant men and
women of everything fleshly, so that nothing but a shadow of them remained,
a spirit vibrating in fine, elusive, dying chords. In his &ldquo;Evening Hymn&rdquo;
girls are singing in the meadow; to judge from their dresses, they should
be the daughters of the peasantry, but one fancies them religious enthusiasts,
brought together upon this mysterious and sequestered corner of the earth
by a melancholy world-weariness, by a yearning after the mystical. Fragile
as glass, sensitive to the ends of their fingers, and, one might say, morbidly
spiritual, they breathe out their souls in song, encompassed by the soft shadows
of the evening twilight, and uttering all the exquisite tenderness of their
subtle temperament in the hymn they chant. Another of his pastoral
symphonies is &ldquo;The Harvest Moon.&rdquo; Farm labourers are plodding homewards
after their day&rsquo;s work. The moon is rising, and casts its soft, subdued
light upon the dark hills and the slender trees, in the silvery leaves of which
the evening wind is playing. &ldquo;The Gander,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Young Anglers,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Cast Shoe&rdquo; are captivating through the same delicacy and the same
mood of peaceful resignation. George Mason is an astonishing artist, almost
always guilty of exaggeration, but always seductive. Life passes in his
pictures like a beautiful summer&rsquo;s day, and with the accompaniment of soft
music. A peaceful, delicate feeling, something mystical, bitter-sweet, and
suffering, lives beneath the light and tender veil of his pictures. They affect
the nerves like a harmonica, and lull one with low and softly veiled harmonies.
Many of the melancholy works of Israels have a similar effect, only Israels
is less refined, has less of distinction and&mdash;more of truth.</p>

<p>This suavity of feeling is characteristic in an almost higher degree of
<i>Fred Walker</i>, a sensitive artist never satisfied with himself. Every one of
his pictures gives the impression of deep and quiet reverie; everywhere
a kind of mood, like that in a fairy tale, colours the ordinary events of life
in his works, an effect produced by his refined composition of forms and
colours. In his classically simple art Mason was influenced by the Italians,
and especially the Umbrians. Walker drew a similar inspiration from the
works of Millet. Both the Englishman and the Frenchman died in the same
year, the former on 20th January 1875, in Barbizon, the latter on 5th June,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>366</span>
in Scotland; and yet in a certain sense they stand at the very opposite poles
of art. Walker is graceful, delicate, and tender; Millet forceful, healthy,
and powerful. &ldquo;To draw sublimity from what is trivial&rdquo; was the aim of
both, and they both reached it by the same path. All their predecessors
had held truth as the foe of beauty, and had qualified shepherds and shepherdesses,
ploughmen and labourers, for artistic treatment by forcing upon
them the smiling grace and the strained humour of <i>genre</i> painting. Millet
and Fred Walker broke with the frivolity of this elder school of painting,
which had seen matter for jesting, and only that, in the life of the rustic;
they asserted that in the life of the toiler nothing was more deserving of
artistic representation than his toil. They always began by reproducing life
as they saw it, and by disdaining, in their effort after truth, all artificial
embellishment; they came to recognise, both of them at the same time, a
dignity in the human frame, and grandiose forms and classic lines in human
movement, which no one had discovered before. With the most pious
reverence for the exact facts of life, there was united that greatness of conception
which is known as style.</p>

<p>Fred Walker, the Tennyson of painting, was born in London in 1840,
and had scarcely left school before the galleries of ancient art in the British
Museum became his favourite place of resort. Drawings for wood-engraving
were his first works, and with Millet in France he has the chief merit of having
put fresh life into the traditional style of English wood engraving, so that
he is honoured by the young school of wood-engravers as their lord and master.
His first, and as yet unimportant, drawings appeared in 1860 in a periodical
called <i>Once a Week</i>, for which Leech, Millais, and others also made drawings.
Shortly after this <i>début</i> he was introduced to Thackeray, then the editor of
<i>Cornhill</i>, and he undertook the illustrations with Millais. In these plates
he is already seen in his charm, grace, and simplicity. His favourite season
is the tender spring, when the earth is clothed with young verdure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>367</span>
and the sunlight glances over the naked branches, and the children pluck
the first flowers which have shot up beneath their covering of snow.</p>

<p>His pictures give pleasure by virtue of the same qualities&mdash;delicacy of
drawing, bloom of colouring, and a grace which is not affected in spite of
its Grecian rhythm.</p>

<p>Walker was the first to introduce that delicate rosy red which has since
been popular in English painting. His method of vision is as widely removed
from that of Manet as from Couture&rsquo;s brown sauce. The surface of every
one of his pictures resembles a rare jewel in its delicate finish: it is soft,
and gives the sense of colour and of refined and soothing harmony. His
first important work, &ldquo;Bathers,&rdquo; was exhibited in 1867 at the Royal Academy,
where works of his appeared regularly during the next five years. About
a score of young people are standing on the verge of a deep and quiet English
river, and are just about to refresh themselves in the tide after a hot August
day. Some, indeed, are already in the water, while others are sitting upon
the grass and others undressing. The frieze of the Parthenon is recalled,
so plastic is the grace of these young frames, and the style and repose of
the treatment of lines, which are such as may only be found in Puvis de
Chavannes. In his next picture, &ldquo;The Vagrants,&rdquo; he represented a group
of gipsies camping round a fire in
the midst of an English landscape.
A mother is nursing her child, while
to the left a woman is standing
plunged in thought, and to the right
a lad is throwing wood upon the
faintly blazing fire. Here, too, the
figures are all drawn severely after
nature and yet have the air of Greek
statues. There is no modern artist
who has united in so unforced a
manner actuality and fidelity to
nature with &ldquo;the noble simplicity
and quiet grandeur&rdquo; of the antique.
In a succeeding picture of 1870,
&ldquo;The Plough,&rdquo; a labourer is striding
over the ground behind the plough.
The long day is approaching its end,
and the moon stands silvery in the
sky. Far into the distance the field
stretches away, and the heavy tread
of the horses mingles in the stillness
of evening with the murmur of the
stream which flows round the grassy
ridge, making its soft complaint.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>368</span>
&ldquo;Man goeth forth to his work and to his labour until the evening&rdquo; is its
thoroughly English motto. The same still mournfulness of sunset he painted
in that work of marvellous tenderness, &ldquo;The Old Gate.&rdquo; The peace of dusk
is resting upon a soft and gentle landscape. A lady who is the owner of a
country mansion and is dressed like a widow has just stepped out from the
garden gate, accompanied by her maid, who is in the act of shutting it;
children are playing on the steps, and a couple of labourers are going past
in front and look towards the lady of the house. It is nothing except the
meeting of certain persons, a scene such as takes place every day, and yet
even here there is a subtlety and tenderness which raise the event from the
prose of ordinary life into a mysterious world of poetry.</p>

<p>In his later period he deviated more and more towards a fragrant lyricism.
In his great picture of 1872, &ldquo;The Harbour of Refuge,&rdquo; the background is
formed by one of those peaceful buildings where the aged poor pass the remainder
of their days in meditative rest. The sun is sinking, and there is a
rising moon. The red-tiled roof stands out clear against the quiet evening
sky, while upon the terrace in front, over which the tremulous yellow rays of
the setting sun are shed, an old woman with a bowed figure is walking, guided
by a graceful girl who steps lightly forward. It is the old contrast between
day and night, youth and age, strength and decay. Yet in Walker there
is no opposition after all. For as light mingles with the shadows in the
twilight, this young and vigorous
woman who paces in the evening,
holding the arm of the aged in
mysterious silence, has at the
moment no sense of her youth,
but is rather filled with that
melancholy thought underlying
Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Warte nur balde</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Wait awhile and thou shalt
rest too.&rdquo; Her eyes have a
strange gaze, as though she were
looking into vacancy in mere
absence of mind. And upon the
other side of the picture this
theme of the transient life of
humanity is still further developed.
Upon a bench in the
midst of a verdant lawn covered
with daisies a group of old men
are sitting meditatively near a
hedge of hawthorn luxuriant in
blossom. Above the bench there
stands an old statue casting a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>369</span>
clearly defined shadow upon the gravel path, as if to point to the contrast
between imperishable stone and the unstable race of men, fading away like
the autumn leaves. Well in the foreground a labourer is mowing down the
tender spring grass with a scythe&mdash;a strange, wild, and rugged figure, a reaper
whose name is Death.</p>

<p>It was not long before evening drew on for the painter, and Death, the
mighty reaper, laid him low.</p>

<p>Of a nervous and sensitive temperament, Walker had one of those natures
which find their way with difficulty through this rude world of fact. Those
little things which he had the art of painting so beautifully, and which occupy
such an important place in his work, had, in another sense, more influence
upon his life than ought to have been the case. While Mason faced all unpleasantnesses
with stoical indifference, Walker allowed himself to be disturbed
and hindered in his work by every failure and every sharp wind of criticism.
In addition to that he was, like Mason, a victim of consumption. A residence
in Algiers merely banished the insidious disease for a short time. Amongst
the last works, which he exhibited in 1875, a considerable stir was made by
a drawing called &ldquo;The Unknown Land&rdquo;: a vessel with naked men is drawing
near the shores of a wide and peaceful island bathed in a magical light. Soon
afterwards Walker had himself departed to that unknown land: he died
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>370</span>
in Scotland when he was five-and-thirty. His body was brought to the
little churchyard at Cookham on the banks of the Thames. In this village
Fred Walker is buried amid the fair river landscape which he so loved and
so often painted.</p>

<p>After the pre-Raphaelite revolution, the foundation of the school of
Walker indicated the last stage of English art. His influence was far greater
than might be supposed from the small number of his works, and fifty per
cent. of the English pictures in every exhibition would perhaps never have
been painted if he had not been born. A national element long renounced,
that old English sentiment which once inspired the landscapes of Gainsborough
and the scenes of Morland, and was lost in the hands of Wilkie and
the <i>genre</i> painters, lives once more in Fred Walker. He adapted it to the
age by adding something of Tennyson&rsquo;s passion for nature. There is a touch
of symbolism in that old gate which he painted in the beautiful picture of
1870. He and Mason opened it so that English art might pass into this
new domain, where musical sentiment is everything, where one is buried
in sweet reveries at the sight of a flock of geese driven by a young girl, or a
labourer stepping behind his plough, or a child playing, free from care, with
pebbles at the water&rsquo;s edge. Their disciples are perhaps healthier, or, should
one say, &ldquo;less refined,&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, not quite so sensitive and hyper-æsthetic
as those who opened the old gate. They seem physically more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>371</span>
robust, and can better face the sharp air of reality. They no longer dissolve
painting altogether into music and poetry; they live more in the world at
every hour, not merely when the sun is setting, but also when the prosaic
daylight exposes objects in their material heaviness. But the tender ground-tone,
the effort to seize nature in soft phases, is the same in all. Like bees,
they suck from reality only its sweets. The earnest, tender, and deeply heartfelt
art of Walker has influenced them all.</p>

<p>Evening when work is over, the end of summer, twilight, autumn, the
pale and golden sky, and the dead leaves are the things which have probably
made the most profound impression on the English spirit. The hour when
toil is laid aside, and rest begins and people seek their homes, and the season
when fires are first lighted are the hour and the season most beloved by this
people, which, with all its rude energy, is yet so tender and full of feeling.
Repose to the point of enervation and the stage where it passes into gentle
melancholy is the theme of their pictures&mdash;this, and not toil.</p>

<p>How many have been painted in the last forty years in which people are
returning from their work of an evening across the country! The people in
the big towns look upon the country with the eyes of a lover, especially those
parts of it which lie near the town; not the scenes painted by Raffaelli, but
the parks and public gardens. Soft, undulating valleys and gently swelling
hills are spread around, the flowers are in bloom, and the leaves glance in the
sunshine. And over this country, with its trim gravel paths and its green,
luxuriant lawns, there comes a well-to-do people. Even the labourers seem
in good case as they go home across the flowery meadows.</p>

<p><i>George H. Boughton</i> was one of the most graceful and refined amongst
Walker&rsquo;s followers. By birth and descent a countryman of Crome and Cotman,
he passed his youth in America, worked several years in Paris from 1853,
and in 1863 settled in London, where he was exceedingly active as a draughtsman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>372</span>
a writer, and a painter. His charming illustrations for <i>Harper&rsquo;s Magazine</i>,
where he also published his delicate story <i>The Return of the Mayflower</i>, are
well known. As a painter, too, his brush was only occupied by pleasant
things, whether belonging to the past or the present. There is something
in him both of the delicacy of Gainsborough and of the poetry of Memlinc.
He delights in the murmur of brooks and the rustle of leaves, in fresh children
and pretty young women in æesthetically fantastic costume; he loves everything
delicate, quiet, and fragrant. And for this reason he also takes delight
in old legends entwined with blossoms, and attains a most harmonious effect
when he places shepherds and kings&rsquo; daughters of story, and steel-clad knights
and squires in his charming and entirely modern landscapes. Almost always
it is autumn, winter, or at most the early spring in his pictures. The boughs
of the trees are generally bare, though sometimes a tender pointed yellowish
verdure is budding upon them. At times the mist of November hovers over
the country like a delicate veil; at times the snowflakes fall softly, or the
October sun gleams through the leafless branches.</p>

<p>Moreover, a feeling for the articulation of lines, for a balance of composition,
unforced, and yet giving a character of distinction, is peculiar to him in a
high degree. In 1877 he had in the Royal Academy the charming picture &ldquo;A
Breath of Wind.&rdquo; Amid a soft landscape with slender trees move the thoroughly
Grecian figures of the shapely English peasants, whilst the tender evening
light is shed over the gently rising hills. His picture of 1878 he named &ldquo;Green
Leaves among the Sere&rdquo;: a group of children, in the midst of whom the
young mother herself looks like a child, are seated amid an autumn landscape,
where the leaves fall, and the sky is
shrouded in wintry grey. In the
picture &ldquo;Snow in Spring&rdquo; may be
seen a party of charming girls&mdash;little
modern Tanagra figures&mdash;whom the
sun has tempted into the air to search
for the earliest woodland snowdrops
under the guidance of a damsel still
in her &rsquo;teens. Having just reached a
secret corner of the wood, they are
standing with their flowers in their
hands surrounded by tremulous
boughs, when a sudden snowstorm
overtakes them. Thick white flakes
alight upon the slender boughs, and
combine with the light green leaves
and pale reddish dresses of the children
in making a delicate harmony of
colour. Among his legendary pictures
the poetic &ldquo;Love Conquers all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>373</span>
Things,&rdquo; in particular is known in Germany: a wild shepherd&rsquo;s daughter sits
near her flock, and the son of a king gazes into her eyes lost in dream.</p>

<p>Boughton is not the only painter of budding girlhood. All English literature
has a tender feminine trait. Tennyson is the poet most widely read, and he
has won all hearts chiefly through his portraits of women: Adeline, Eleänore,
Lilian, and the May Queen&mdash;that delightful gallery of pure and noble figures.
In English painting, too, it is seldom men who are represented, but more
frequently women and children, especially little maidens in their fresh pure
witchery.</p>

<p>Belonging still to the older period there is <i>Philip H. Calderon</i>, an exceedingly
fertile although lukewarm and academical artist, in whose blood is a
good deal of effeminate Classicism. When his name appears in a catalogue
it means that the spectator will be led into an artificial region peopled with
pretty girls&mdash;beings who are neither sad nor gay, and who belong neither to
the present nor to ancient times, to no age in particular and to no clime.
Whenever such ethereal girlish figures wear the costume of the Directoire
period, <i>Marcus Stone</i> is their father. He is likewise one of the older men
whose first appearance was made before the time of Walker. His young
ladies part broken-hearted from a beloved suitor, turned away by their father,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>374</span>
and save the honour of their family by giving their hand to a wealthy but
unloved aspirant, or else they are solitary and lost in tender reveries. In
his earliest period Marcus Stone had a preference for interiors; rich Directoire
furniture and objects of art indicate with exactness the year in which the
narrative takes place. Later, he took a delight in placing his <i>rococo</i> ladies
and gentlemen in the open air, upon the terraces of old gardens or in sheltered
alleys. All his pictures are pretty, the faces, the figures, and the accessories;
in relation to them one may use the adjective &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; in its positive, comparative,
or superlative degree. In England Marcus Stone is the favourite
painter of &ldquo;sweethearts,&rdquo; and it cannot be easy to go so near the boundaries
of candied <i>genre</i> painting and yet always to preserve a certain <i>noblesse</i>.</p>

<p>Amongst later artists <i>G. D. Leslie</i>, the son of Charles Leslie, has specially
the secret of interpreting innocent feminine beauty, that somewhat predetermined
but charming grace derived from Gainsborough and the eighteenth
century. A young lady who has lately been married is paying a visit to her
earlier school friends, and is gazed upon as though she were an angel by these
charming girls. Or his pretty maidens have ensconced themselves beneath
the trees, or stand on the shore watching a boat at sunset, or amuse themselves
from a bridge in a park by throwing flowers into the water and looking
dreamily after them as they float away. Leslie&rsquo;s pictures, too, are very
pretty and poetic, and have much silk in them and much sun, while the soft
pale method of painting, so highly æsthetic in its delicate attenuation of
colour, corresponds with the delicacy of their purport.</p>

<p><i>P. G. Morris</i>, not less delicate in feeling and execution, became specially
known by a &ldquo;Communion in Dieppe.&rdquo; Directly facing the spectator a
train of pretty communicants move upon the seashore, assuming an air of
dignified superiority, like young ladies from Brighton or Folkestone. A
bluish light plays over the white dresses of the girls and over the blue jackets
of the sailors lounging about the quay; it fills the pale blue sky with a misty
vibration and glances sportively upon the green waves of the sea. &ldquo;The
Reaper and the Flowers&rdquo; was a thoroughly English picture, a graceful
allegory after the fashion of Fred Walker. On their way from school
a party of children meet at the verge of a meadow an old peasant going
home from his day&rsquo;s work with a scythe upon his shoulder. In the
dancing step of the little ones may be seen the influence of Greek statues;
they float along as if borne by the zephyr, with a rhythmical motion
which is seldom found in real school-children. But the old peasant coming
towards them is intended to recall the contrast between youth and age
as in Fred Walker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Harbour of Refuge&rdquo;; while the scythe glittering
in the last rays of the setting sun signifies the scythe of Fate, the scythe
of death which does not even spare the child.</p>

<p>And thus the limits of
English painting are defined.
It always reveals a certain
conflict between fact and
poetry, reverie and life.
For whenever the scene
does not admit of a directly
ethical interpretation, refuge
is invariably taken in lyricism.
The wide field which
lies between, where powerful
works are nourished, works
which have their roots in
reality, and derive their life
from it alone, has not been
definitely conquered by
English art. England is
the greatest producer and
consumer in the world, and
her people press the marrow
out of things as no other
have ever done: and yet
this land of industry knows
nothing of pictures in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>378</span>
work is being accomplished; this country, which is a network of railway
lines, has never seen a railway painted. Even horses are less and less
frequently represented in English art, and sport finds no expression there
whatever. Much as the Englishman loves it from a sense of its wholesomeness,
he does not consider it sufficiently æsthetic to be painted, a matter
upon which Wilkie Collins enlarges in an amusing way in his book <i>Man
and Wife</i>.</p>

<p>And in English pictures there are no poor, or, at any rate, none who are
wretched in the extreme. For although the Chelsea Pensioners were a
favoured theme in painting, there were none of them miserable and heavy-laden;
they were rather types of the happy poor who were carefully tended.
If English painters are otherwise induced to represent the poor, they depict
a room kept in exemplary order, and endeavour to display some touching
or admirable trait in honest and admirable people. In fact, people seem to
be good and honourable wherever they are found. Everywhere there is
content and humility, even in misfortune. Even where actual need is represented,
it is only done in the effort to give expression to what is moving
in certain dispensations of fate, and to create a lofty and conciliating effect
by the contrast between misfortune and man&rsquo;s noble trust in God.</p>

<p><i>John R. Reid</i>, a Scotchman by birth, but residing in London, has treated
scenes from life upon the seacoast in this manner. How different his works
are from the tragedies of Joseph Israels, or the grim naturalism of Michael
Ancher! He occupies himself only with the bright side of life with its colour
and sunshine, not with the dark side with its toils. He paints the inhabitants
of the country in their Sunday best, as they sit telling stories, or as they go
a-hunting, or regale themselves in the garden of an inn. The old rustics
who sit happy with their pipes and beer in his &ldquo;Cricket Match&rdquo; are typical
of everything that he has painted.</p>

<p>And even when, once in a way, a more gloomy trait appears in his pictures,
it is there only that the light may shine the more brightly. The poor old
flute-player who sits homeless upon a bench near the house is placed there
merely to show how well off are the children who are hurrying merrily home
after school. His picture of 1890, indeed, treated a scene of shipwreck, but
a passage from a poet stood beneath; there was not a lost sailor to be seen,
and all the tenderness of the artist is devoted to the pretty children and the
young women gazing with anxiety and compassion across the sea.</p>

<p><i>Frank Holl</i> was in the habit of giving his pictures a more lachrymose
touch, together with a more sombre and ascetic harmony of colour. He
borrowed his subjects from the life of the humble classes, always searching,
moreover, for melancholy features; he took delight in representing human
virtue in misfortune, and for the sake of greater effect he frequently chose
a verse from the Bible as the title. Thus the work with which he first won
the English public was a picture exhibited in 1869: &ldquo;The Lord gave, the
Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.&rdquo; A family of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>379</span>
five brothers and sisters, who have just lost their mother, are assembled
round the breakfast-table in a poorly furnished room. One sister is crying,
another is sadly looking straight before her, whilst a third is praying with
folded hands. The younger brother, a sailor, has just reached home from
a voyage, to close his dying mother&rsquo;s eyes, and the eldest of all, a young and
earnest curate, is endeavouring to console his brothers and sisters with the
words of Job.</p>

<p>The next picture, exhibited in 1871, he called &ldquo;No Tidings from the
Sea,&rdquo; and represented in it a fisherman&rsquo;s family&mdash;grandmother, mother,
and child&mdash;who in a cheerless room are anxiously expecting the return of
a sailor. &ldquo;Leaving Home&rdquo; showed four people sitting on a bench outside
a waiting-room at a railway station. To awaken the spectator&rsquo;s pity &ldquo;Third
Class&rdquo; is written in large letters upon the window just above their heads.
The principal figure is a lady dressed in black, who is counting, in a somewhat
obtrusive manner, the little money which she still has left.</p>

<p>In the picture &ldquo;Necessity knows no Law&rdquo; a poor woman with a child
in her arms has entered a pawnshop to borrow money on her wedding-ring;
in another, women of the poorer class are to be seen walking along with their
soldier sons and husbands, who have been called out on active service. One
of them clasps tightly to her breast her little child, the only one still remaining
to her in life, whilst an aged widow presses the hand of her son with the
sad presentiment that, even if he comes back to her, she will probably not
have long to live after his return. Not only did Frank Holl paint stories
for his countrymen, but he also painted them big in majuscule characters
which were legible without spectacles, and he partially owed his splendid
successes to this cheap sentimentality.</p>

<p>Almost everywhere the interest of subject still plays the first part, and
this slightly lachrymose trait bordering on <i>genre</i>, this lyrically tender or
allegorically subtle element, which runs through English figure pictures,
would easily degenerate into vaporous enervation in another country. In
England portrait painting, which now, as in the days of Reynolds, is the
greatest title to honour possessed by English art, invariably maintains its
union with direct reality. By acknowledgment portrait painting in the
present day is exceedingly earnest: it admits of no decorative luxuriousness,
no sport with hangings and draperies, no pose; and English likenesses have
this severe actuality in the highest degree. Stiff-necked obstinacy, sanguine
resolution, and muscular force of will are often spoken of as an Englishman&rsquo;s
national characteristics, and a trace of these qualities is also betrayed in
English portrait painting. The self-reliance of the English is far too great
to suffer or demand any servile habit of flattery: everything is free from
pose, plain and simple. Let the subject be the weather-beaten figure of
an old sailor or the dazzling freshness of English youth, there is a remarkable
energy and force of life in all their works, even in the pictures of children
with their broad open brow, finely chiselled nose, and assured and penetrative
glance. And as portrait painting in England, to its own advantage and the
benefit of all art, has never been considered as an isolated province, such
pictures may be specified among the works of the most frigid academician
as well as amongst those of the most vigorous naturalist. Frank Holl, who
had such a Düsseldorfian tinge in his more elaborate pictures, showed at the
close of his life, in his likenesses of the engraver Samuel Cousins, Lord Dufferin,
Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, Lord Wolseley, Mr. Gladstone, the Duke of Cleveland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>381</span>
Sir George Trevelyan, and Lord Spencer, a simple virility altogether
wanting in his earlier works. They had a trenchant characterisation and an
unforced pose which were striking even in England. It is scarcely possible
to exhibit people more naturally, or more completely to banish from their
expression that concentrated air of attentiveness which suggests photography
and so easily intrudes into a portrait. Even Leighton, so devoid of temperament,
so entirely devoted to the measured art of the ancients, became at
once nervous and
almost brutal in his
power when he
painted a portrait in
place of ideal Grecian
figures. His vivid
and forcible portrait
of Sir Richard Burton,
the celebrated
African traveller,
would do honour to
the greatest portrait
painter of the Continent.</p>

<p>Amongst portrait
painters by profession
<i>Walter Ouless</i>
will probably merit
the place of honour
immediately after
Watts as an impressive
exponent of
character. He has assimilated
much from
his master Millais&mdash;not
merely the heaviness
of colour, which
often has a disturbing
effect in the latter,
but also Millais&rsquo;
powerful flight of
style, always so free
from false rhetoric.
The chemical expert
Pochin, as Ouless
painted him in 1865,
does not pose in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>382</span>
picture nor allow himself to be disturbed in his researches. It is a
thoroughly contemporary portrait, one of those brilliant successes which
later occurred in France also. The Recorder of London, Mr. Russell
Gurney, he likewise painted in his professional character and in his robes
of office. In its inflexible graveness and earnest dignity the likeness is
almost more than the portrait of an individual; it seems the embodiment
of the proud English Bench resting upon the most ancient traditions.
His portrait of Cardinal Manning had the same convincing power of
observation, the same large and sure technique. The soft light plays upon
the ermine and the red stole, and falls full upon the fine, austere, and
noble face.</p>

<p>Besides Ouless mention may be made from among the great number of
portrait painters of <i>J. J. Shannon</i>, with his powerful and firmly painted
likenesses; of <i>James Sant</i>, with his sincere and energetic portraits of women;
of <i>Mouat Loudan</i>, with his pretty pictures of children, and of the many-sided
<i>Charles W. Furse</i>. Hubert Herkomer was the most celebrated in Germany,
and is probably the most skilful of the young men whom <i>The Graphic</i> brought
into eminence in the seventies.</p>

<p>The career of <i>Hubert Herkomer</i>
is amongst those adventurous
ones which become less and less
frequent in the nineteenth century;
there are not many who
have risen so rapidly to fame
and fortune from such modest
circumstances. His father was
a carver of sacred images in
the little Bavarian village of
Waal, where Hubert was born in
1849. In 1851 the enterprising
Bavarian tried his fortune in the
New World. But there he did
not succeed in making progress,
and in 1857 the family appeared
in England, at Southampton.
Here he fought his way honestly
at the bench where he carved,
and as a journeyman worker,
whilst his wife gave lessons in
music. A commission to carve
Peter Vischer&rsquo;s four evangelists
in wood brought him with his son
to Munich, where they occupied
room in the back buildings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>383</span>
a master-carpenter&rsquo;s house, in which they slept, cooked, and worked. In the
preparatory class of the Munich Academy the younger Herkomer received
his first teaching, and began to draw from the nude, the antique serving as
model. At a frame-maker&rsquo;s in Southampton he gave his first exhibition,
and drew illustrations for a comic paper. With the few pence which he
saved from these earnings he went to London, where he lived from hand to
mouth with a companion as poor as himself. He cooked, and his friend scoured
the pans; meanwhile he worked as a mason on the frieze of the South Kensington
Museum, and hired himself out for the evenings as a zither-player.
Then <i>The Graphic</i> became his salvation, and after his drawings had made
him known he soon had success with his paintings. &ldquo;After the Toil of the
Day,&rdquo; a picture which he exhibited in the Royal Academy of 1873&mdash;a thoughtful
scene from the village life of Bavaria, carried out after the manner of
Fred Walker&mdash;found a purchaser immediately. He was then able to make
a home for his parents in the village of Bushey, which he afterwards glorified
in the picture &ldquo;Our Village,&rdquo; and he began his masterpiece &ldquo;The Last
Muster,&rdquo; which obtained in 1878 the great medal at the World Exhibition
in Paris. Since then he found the eyes of the English public fixed upon
him. There followed at first a series of pictures in which he proceeded upon
the lines of Fred Walker&rsquo;s poetic realism: &ldquo;Eventide,&rdquo; a scene in the Westminster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>384</span>
Union; &ldquo;The Gloom of Idwal,&rdquo; a romantic mountain picture from
North Wales; &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Shrine,&rdquo; a lonely Bavarian hillside path, with
peasants praying at a shrine; &ldquo;Der Bittgang,&rdquo; a group of country people
praying for harvest; &ldquo;Contrasts,&rdquo; a picture of English ladies surrounded
by school-children in the Bavarian mountains. At the same time he became
celebrated as a portrait painter, his first successes in this field being the
likenesses of Wagner and Tennyson, Archibald Forbes, his own father, John
Ruskin, Stanley, and the conductor Hans Richter. And he reached the
summit of his international fame when his portrait of Miss Grant, &ldquo;The
Lady in White,&rdquo; appeared in 1886; all Europe spoke of it at the time, and
it called forth entire bundles of poems, anecdotes, biographies, and romances.
From that time he advanced in his career with rapid strides.</p>

<p>The University of Oxford appointed him Professor of the Fine Arts. He
opened a School of Art, and had etchings, copper engravings, and engravings
in mezzotint produced by his pupils under his guidance. He wrote articles
in the London papers upon social questions, and political economy, and
all manner of subjects, an article signed with Herkomer&rsquo;s name being always
capable of creating interest.
He has his own theatre, and
produces in it operas of
which he writes the text and
the music, and manages the
rehearsals and the scenery,
besides playing the leading
parts.</p>

<p>Yet it is just his portraits
of women, the foundations of
his fame, which do not seem
in general to justify entirely
the painter&rsquo;s great reputation.
Miss Grant was certainly
a captivating woman,
and she broke men&rsquo;s hearts
wherever she made her appearance.
People gazed again
and again into the brilliant
brown eyes with which she
looked so composedly before
her; they were overwhelmed
by her austere and lofty
virginal beauty. &ldquo;The Lady
in Black (An American
Lady)&rdquo; made yet a more
piquant and spiritualised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>385</span>
effect. There was the unopened bud, and here the woman who has had
experience of the delights and disappointments of life. There was unapproachable
pride, and here a trait of distinction and of suffering, an almost weary
carriage of the body. There would certainly be an interesting gallery of beauty
if Herkomer unite these &ldquo;types of women&rdquo; in a series. But even in the
first picture how much of all the admiration excited was due to the painter
and how much to the model? The portrait of Miss Grant was such a success
primarily because Miss Grant herself was so beautiful. The arrangement
of white against white was nothing new: Whistler, a far greater artist, had
already painted a &ldquo;White Girl&rdquo; in 1863, and it was a much greater work of
art, though, on account of the attractiveness of the model being less powerful,
it triumphed only in the narrower circle of artists. Bastien-Lepage, who
set himself the same problem in his &ldquo;Sara Bernhardt,&rdquo; had also run through
the scale of white with greater sureness. And Herkomer&rsquo;s later pictures of
women&mdash;&ldquo;The Lady in Yellow,&rdquo; Lady Helen Fergusson, and others&mdash;are
even less alluring, considered as works of art. The reserve and evenness of
the execution give his portraits a somewhat clotted and stiff appearance.
Good modelling and exceedingly vigorous drawing may perhaps ensure great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>386</span>
correctness in the counterfeit of the originals, but the life of the picture vanishes
beneath the greasy technique, the soapy painting through which materials
of drapery and flesh-tints assume quite the same values. There is nothing
in it of the transparency, the rosy delicacy, freshness, and flower-like bloom
of Gainsborough&rsquo;s women and girls. Herkomer appears in these pictures as
a salon painter in whom a tame but tastefully cultivated temperament is
expressed with charm. Even his landscapes with their trim peasants&rsquo; cottages
and their soft moods of sunset have not enriched with new notes the scale
executed by Walker.</p>

<p>All the more astonishing is the earnest certainty of touch and the robust
energy which are visible in his other works. His portraits of men, especially
the one of his father, that kingly old man with the long, white beard and
the furrowed brow, take their place beside the best productions of English
portraiture, which are chiselled, as it were, in stone. In &ldquo;The Last Muster&rdquo;
he showed that it is possible to be simple and yet strike a profound note and
even attain greatness. For there is something great in these old warriors,
who at the end of their days are praying, having never troubled themselves
over prayer during all their lives, who have travelled so far and staked their
lives dozens of times, and are now drawing their last breath softly upon the
seats of a church. Even his more recent groups&mdash;&ldquo;The Assemblage of the
Curators of the Charterhouse&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Session of the Magistrates of
Landsberg&rdquo;&mdash;are magnificent examples of realistic art, full of imposing
strength and soundness. In the representation of these citizens the genius
of the master who in his &ldquo;Chelsea Pensioners&rdquo; created one of the &ldquo;Doelen
pieces&rdquo; of the nineteenth century, revealed itself afresh in all its greatness.</p>

<p>Beside portrait painting the painting of landscape stands now as ever in
full bloom amongst the English; not that the artists of to-day are more
consistently faithful to truth than their predecessors, or that they seem more
modern in the study of light. In the province of landscape as in that of figure
painting, far more weight is laid upon subject than on the moods of atmosphere.
If one compares the modern English painters with Crome and Constable,
one finds them wanting in boldness and creative force; and placed beside
Monet, they seem to be diffident altogether. But a touching reverence for
nature gives almost all their pictures a singularly chaste and fragrant charm.</p>

<p>Of course, all the influences which have affected English art in other
respects are likewise reflected in landscape painting. The epoch-making
activity of the pre-Raphaelites, the passionate earnestness of Ruskin&rsquo;s love
for nature, as well as the influence of foreign art, have all left their traces.
In his own manner Constable had spoken the last word. The principal thing
in him, as in Cox, was the study of atmospheric effects and of the dramatic
life of air. They neither of them troubled themselves about local colour,
but sought to render the tones which are formed under atmospheric and
meteorological influences; they altogether sacrificed the completion of the
details of subject to seizing the momentary impression. In Turner, generally
speaking, it was only the air that lived. Trees and buildings, rocks and
water, are merely <i>repoussoirs</i> for the atmosphere; they are exclusively
ordained to lead the eye through the mysterious depths of light and shadow.
The intangible absorbed what could be touched and handled. As a natural
reaction there came this pre-Raphaelite landscape, and by a curious irony
of chance the writer who had done most for Turner&rsquo;s fame was also he who
first welcomed this pre-Raphaelite landscape school. Everything which the
old school had neglected now became the essential object of painting. The
landscape painters fell in love with the earth, with the woods and the fields;
and the more autumn resolved the wide green harmony of nature into a
sport of colours multiplied a thousand times, the more did they love it.
Thousands of things were there to be seen. First, how the foliage turned
yellow and red and brown, and then how it fell away: how it was scattered
upon a windy day, whirling in a yellow drift of leaves; how in still weather
leaf after leaf lightly rustled to the ground from between the wavering brown
boughs. And then when the foliage fell from the trees and bushes the
most inviolate secrets of summer came to light; there lay around quantities
of bright seeds and berries rich in colour, brown nuts, smooth acorns, black
and glossy sloes, and scarlet haws. In the leafless beeches there clustered
pointed beechmast, the mugwort bent beneath its heavy red bunches, late
blackberries lay black and brown amid the damp foliage upon the road,
bilberries grew amid the heather, and wild raspberries bore their dull red
fruit once again. The dying ferns took a hundred colours; the moss shot
up like the ears of a miniature cornfield. Eager as children the landscape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>390</span>
painters roamed here and there across the woodland, to discover its treasures
and its curiosities. They understood how to paint a bundle of hay with such
exactness that a botanist could decide upon the species of every blade. One
of them lived for three months under canvas, so as thoroughly to know a
landscape of heath. Confused through detail, they lost their view of the
whole, and only made a return to modernity when they came to study the
Parisian landscape painters. Thus English art in this matter made a curious
circuit, giving and taking. First, the English fertilised French art; but at
the time when French artists stood under the influence of the English, the
latter swerved in the opposite direction, until they ultimately received from
France the impulse which led them back into the old way.</p>

<p>In accordance with these different influences, several currents which
cross and mingle with each other are to be found flowing side by side in English
landscape painting: upon one side a spirit of prosaic reasonableness, a striving
after clearness and precision, which does not know how to sacrifice detail, and
is therefore wanting in pictorial totality of effect; on the other side an artistic
pantheism which rises at times to high lyrical poetry in spite of many dissonances.</p>

<p>The pictures of <i>Cecil Lawson</i> lead to the point where the pre-Raphaelites
begin. The elder painters, with their powerful treatment and the freedom
and boldness of their execution, still keep altogether on the lines of Constable,
whereas in later painters, with their minute elaboration of all particularities,
the influence of the pre-Raphaelites becomes more and more apparent.</p>

<p>Where Cecil Lawson ended, <i>James Clarke Hook</i> began, the great master-spirit
who opened the eyes of the world fifty years ago to the depth of colouring
and the enchanting life of nature, even in its individual details. His pictures,
especially those sunsets which he paints with such delight, have something
devout and religious in them; they have the effect of a prayer or a hymn,
and often possess a solemnity which is entirely biblical, in spite of their brusque,
pungent colours. In his later period he principally devoted himself to sea-pieces,
and in doing so receded from the pre-Raphaelite painting of detail,
which is characteristic of his youthful period. His pictures give one the
breath of the sea, and his sailors are old sea-wolves. All that remains from
his pre-Raphaelite period is that, as a rule, they carry a certain burden of
ideas.</p>

<p><i>Vicat Cole</i>, likewise one of the older school, is unequal and less important.
From many of his pictures one receives the impression that he has directly
copied Constable, and others are bathed in dull yellow tones; nevertheless
he has sometimes painted autumn pictures, felicitous and noble landscapes,
in which there is really a reflection of the sun of Claude Lorrain.</p>

<p>With much greater freedom does <i>Colin Hunter</i> approach nature, and he
has the secret of seizing her boldly in her most impressive moments. The
twilight, with its mysterious, interpenetrating tremor of colours of a thousand
shades, its shine and glimmer of water, with the sky brooding heavily above,
is what fascinates him most of all. Sometimes he represents the dawn, as
in &ldquo;The Herring Market at Sea&rdquo;; sometimes the pale tawny sunset, as in
&ldquo;The Gatherers of Seaweed,&rdquo; in the South Kensington Museum. His men are
always in a state of restless activity, whether they are making the most of the
last moments of light or facing the daybreak with renewed energies.</p>

<p>Although resident in London, he and Hook are the true standard-bearers
of the forcible Scotch school of landscape. <i>MacCallum</i>, <i>MacWhirter</i>, and
<i>James Macbeth</i>, with whom <i>John Brett</i>, the landscape painter of Cornwall,
may be associated, are all gnarled, Northern personalities. Their strong,
dark tones stand often beside each other with a little hardness, but they sum
up the great glimpses of nature admirably. Their brush has no tenderness,
their spirit does not lightly yield to dreaminess, but they stand with both
feet firmly planted on the earth, and they clasp reality in a sound and manly
fashion with both arms. Their deep-toned pictures, with red wooden houses,
darkly painted vessels, veiled skies, and rude fishermen with all their heart
in their work, waken strong and intimate emotions. The difference between
these Scots and the tentative spirits of the younger generation of the following
of Walker and Mason is like that between Rousseau and Dupré as opposed
to Chintreuil and Daubigny. The Scotch painters are sombre and virile;
they have an accent of depth and truth, and a dark, ascetic harmony of colour.
Even as landscape painters the English love what is delicate in nature, what
is refined and tender, familiar and modest: blossoming apple-trees and budding
birches, the odour of the cowshed and the scent of hay, the chime of sheep-bells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>394</span>
and the hum of gnats. They seek no great emotions, but are merely
amiable and kindly, and their pictures give one the feeling of standing at the
window upon a country excursion, and looking out at the laughing and budding
spring. In her novel <i>North and South</i> Mrs. Gaskell has given charming expression
to the glow of this feeling of having fled from the smoke and dirt of
industrial towns to breathe the fresh air and see the sun go down in the prosperous
country, where the meadows are fresh and well-kept, and where the
flowers are fragrant and the leaves glisten in the sunshine. In the pictures
of the Scotch artists toiling men are moving busily; for the English, nature
merely exists that man may have his pleasure in her. Not only is everything
which renders her the prosaic handmaiden of mankind scrupulously avoided,
but all abruptnesses of landscape, all the chance incidents of mountain scenery;
and, indeed, they are not of frequent occurrence in nature as she is in England.
A familiar corner of the country is preferred to wide prospects, and some quiet
phase to nature in agitation. Soft, undulating valleys, gently spreading hills
conforming to the Hogarthian line of beauty, are especially favoured. And
should the rainbow, the biblical symbol of atonement, stand in the sky, the
landscape is for English eyes in the zenith of its beauty.</p>

<p>There is <i>Birket Forster</i>, one of the first and most energetic followers of
Walker&mdash;Birket Forster, whose charming woodcuts became known in Germany
likewise; <i>Inchbold</i>, who with a light hand combines the tender green of the
grasses upon the dunes and the bright blue of the sea into a whole pervaded
with light, and of great refinement; <i>Leader</i>, whose bright evening landscapes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>395</span>
and <i>Corbet</i>, whose delicate moods of morning, are so beautiful. <i>Mark Fisher</i>,
who in the matter of tones closely follows the French landscape school, though
he remains entirely English in sentiment, has painted with great artistic
power the dreamy peace of solitary regions as well as the noisy and busy life
of the purlieus of the town. <i>John White</i>, in 1882, signalised himself with a
landscape, &ldquo;Gold and Silver,&rdquo; which was bathed in light and air. The gold
was a waving cornfield threaded by a sandy little yellow path; the silver was
the sea glittering and sparkling in the background. Moved by Birket Forster,
<i>Ernest Parton</i> seeks to combine refinement of tone with incisiveness in the
painting of detail. His motives are usually quite simple&mdash;a stream and a
birch wood in the dusk, a range of poplars stretching dreamily along the side
of a ditch. <i>Marshall</i> painted gloomy London streets enveloped in mist;
<i>Docharty</i> blossoming hawthorn bushes and autumn evening with russet-leaved
oaks; while <i>Alfred East</i> became the painter of spring in all its fragrance, when
the meadows are resplendent in their earliest verdure, and the leaves of the
trees which have just unfolded stand out against the firmament in light green
patches of colour, when the limes are blossoming and the crops begin to sprout.
<i>M. J. Aumonier</i> appears in the harmony of colouring, and in the softness of
his fine, light-hued tones, as the true heir of Walker and Mason. A discreet
and intimate sense of poetry pervades his valleys with their veiled and golden
light, a fertile odour of the earth streams from his rich meadows, and from
all the luxuriant, cultivated, and peacefully idyllic tracts which he has painted
so lovingly and so well. <i>Gregory</i>, <i>Knight</i>, <i>Alfred Parsons</i>, <i>David Fulton</i>,
<i>A. R. Brown</i>, and <i>St. Clair Simmons</i> have all something personal in their
work, a bashful tenderness beneath what is seemingly arid. The study of
water-colour would alone claim a chapter for itself. Since water-colour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>396</span>
allows of more breadth and
unity than oil-painting, it is
precisely here that there may
be found exceedingly charming
and discreet concords, softly
chiming tones of delicate blue,
greenish, and rosy light, giving
the most refined sensations
produced by English colouring.</p>

<p>Of course, England has a
great part to play in the
painting of the sea. It is not
for nothing that a nation
occupies an insular and maritime
position, above all with
such a sea and upon such
coasts, and the English painter
knows well how to give an
heroic and poetic cast to the
weather-beaten features of the
sailor. For thirty years <i>Henry
Moore</i>, the elder brother of
Albert Moore, was the undisputed
monarch of this province
of art. Moore began as
a landscape painter. From
1853 to 1857 he painted the glistening cliffs and secluded
nooks of Cumberland, and then the green valleys of Switzerland flooded
with the summer air and the clear morning light&mdash;quiet scenes of rustic
life, the toil of the wood-cutter and the haymaker, somewhat as Julien
Dupré handles such matters at the present time in Paris. From 1858 he
began his conquest of the sea, and in the succeeding interval he painted it
in all the phases of its changing life,&mdash;at times in grey and sombre morning,
at other times when the sun stands high; at times in quietude, at other
times when the wind sweeps heavily across the waves, when the storm rises
or subsides, when the sky is clouded or when it brightens. It is a joy to follow
him in all quarters of the world, to see how he constantly studies the waves
of every zone on fair or stormy days, amid the clearness and brilliancy of
the mirror of the sea, as amid the strife of the elements; as a painter he is,
at the same time, always a student of nature, and treats the sea as though
he had to paint its portrait. In the presence of his sea-pieces one has the
impression of a window opening suddenly upon the ocean. Henry Moore
measures the boundless expanse quite calmly, like a captain calculating the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>397</span>
chances of being able to make a crossing. Nowhere else does there live any
painter who regards the sea so much with the eyes of a sailor, and who combines
such eminent qualities with this objective and cool, attentive observation,
which seems to behold in the sea merely its navigable capacity.</p>

<p>The painter of the river-port of London and the arm of the Thames is
<i>William L. Wyllie</i>, whose pictures unite so much bizarre grandeur with so
much precision. One knows the port life of the Thames, with its accumulation
of work, which has not its like upon the whole planet. Everything
is colossal. From Greenwich up to London both sides of the river are a
continuous quay: everywhere there are goods being piled, sacks being raised
on pulleys, ships being laid at anchor; everywhere are fresh storehouses
for copper, beer, sails, tar, and chemicals. The river is of great width, and
is like a street populated with ships, a workshop winding again and again.
The steamers and sailing vessels move up and down stream, or lie in masses,
close beside one another, at anchor. Upon the bank the docks lie athwart
like so many streets of water, sending out ships or taking them in. The
ranks of masts and the slender rigging form a spider&rsquo;s web spreading across
the whole horizon; and a vaporous haze, penetrated by the sun, envelops
it with a reddish veil. Every dock is like a town, filled with huge vats and
populated with a swarm of human
beings, that move hither and
thither amid fluttering shadows.
This vast panorama, veiled with
smoke and mist, only now and then
broken by a ray of sunlight, is the
theme of Wyllie&rsquo;s pictures. Even
as a child he ran about in the port
of London, clambered on to the
ships, noted the play of the waves,
and wandered about the docks; and
so he painted his pictures afterwards
with all the technical knowledge
of a sailor. There is no one
who knows so well how ships stand
in the water; no one has such an
understanding of their details: the
heavy sailing vessels and the great
steamers, which lie in the brown
water of the port like mighty
monsters, the sailors and the movements
of the dock labourers, the
dizzy tide of men, the confusion of
cabs and drays upon the bridges
spanning the arm of the Thames;
only Vollon in Paris is to be compared with him as painter of a
river-port.</p>

<p>Apart from him, <i>Clara Montalba</i> specially has painted the London port
in delicate water-colours. Yet she is almost more at home in Venice, the
Venice of Francesco Guardi, with its magic gleam, its canals, regattas, and
palaces, the Oriental and dazzling splendour of San Marco, the austere grace
of San Giorgio Maggiore, the spirited and fantastic <i>décadence</i> of Santa Maria
della Salute. Elsewhere English water-colour often enters into a fruitless
rivalry with oil-painting, but Clara Montalba cleaves to the old form which
in other days under Bonington, David Cox, and Turner was the chief glory
of the English school. She throws lightly upon paper notes and effects
which have struck her, and the memory of which she wishes to retain.</p>

<p>For the English painters of the day, so far as they do not remain in the
country, Venice has become what the East was for the earlier generations.
They no longer study the romantic Venice which Turner painted and Byron
sang in <i>Childe Harold</i>, they do not paint the noble beauty of Venetian architecture
or its canals glowing in the sun, but the Venice of the day, with its
narrow alleys and pretty girls, Venice with its marvellous effects of light
and the picturesque figures of its streets. Nor are they at pains to discover
&ldquo;ideal&rdquo; traits in the character of the Italian people. They paint true,
everyday scenes from popular life, but these are glorified by the magic of
light. After Zezzos, Ludwig Passini, Cecil van Haanen, Tito, and Eugène
Blaas, the Englishmen Luke Fildes, W. Logsdail, and Henry Woods are
the most skilful painters of Venetian street scenes. In the pictures of <i>Luke
Fildes</i> and <i>W. Logsdail</i> there are usually to be seen in the foreground beautiful
women, painted life-size, washing linen in the canal or seated knitting at
the house door; the heads are bright and animated, the colours almost
glaringly vivid. <i>Henry Woods</i>, the brother-in-law of Luke Fildes, rather
followed the paths prescribed by Favretto in such pictures as &ldquo;Venetian
Trade in the Streets,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sale of an Old Master,&rdquo; &ldquo;Preparation or the
First Communion,&rdquo; &ldquo;Back from the Rialto,&rdquo; and the like; of all the English
he has carried out the study of bright daylight most consistently. The
little glass house which he built in 1879 at the back of the Palazzo Vendramin
became the model of all the glass studios now disseminated over the city of
the lagunes.</p>

<p>And these labours in Venice contributed in no unessential manner to
lead English painting, in general, away from its one-sided æsthetics and
rather more into the mud of the streets, caused it to break with its finely
accorded tones, and brought it to a more earnest study of light. Beside
his idealised Venetian women, Luke Fildes also painted large pictures from
the life of the English people, such as &ldquo;The Return of the Lost One,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Widower,&rdquo; and the like, which struck tones more earnest than English painting
does elsewhere; and in his picture of 1878, &ldquo;The Poor of London,&rdquo; he even
recalled certain sketches which Gavarni drew during his rambles through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>401</span>
the poverty-stricken quarter of London. The poor starving figures in this
work were rendered quite realistically and without embellishment; the
general tone was a greenish-grey, making a forcible change from the customary
light blue of English pictures. <i>Dudley Hardy&rsquo;s</i> huge picture &ldquo;Homeless,&rdquo;
where a crowd of human beings are sleeping at night in the open air at the
foot of a monument in London, and <i>Jacomb Hood&rsquo;s</i> plain scenes from London
street life, are other works which in recent years were striking, from having
a character rather French than English. <i>Stott of Oldham</i>, by his pretty
pictures of the dunes with children playing, powerful portraits, and delicate,
vaporous moonlight landscapes, has won many admirers on the Continent
also. <i>Stanhope Forbes</i> painted &ldquo;A Philharmonic Society in the Country,&rdquo; a
representation of an auction, and scenes from the career of the Salvation
Army, in which he restrained himself from all subordinate ideas of a poetic
turn.</p>

<p>In the same way those artists are important who work according to the
demands of decorative painting. A picture in a room should be like a jewel
in its setting, in harmony. It should fit agreeably into the scheme of decoration,
its colour in unison, its lines melodious, its general effect toning well
with the general design.</p>

<p>These principles, taught by Morris, have had a formative influence on
the work of a large number of artists. There arose a tendency which, by
borrowing characteristic effects from woodwork, carpets, and stained-glass,
and by the application of style to line as well as to colour, went one step
further than Burne-Jones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>402</span></p>

<p>The pictures of <i>John W. Waterhouse</i>, for instance, are not only conceived
in literary vein, but seen with the eye of a painter. By smooth, thick lines,
by the discordant harmony of blues, greens, and violet, he gets a carpet-like
effect which is highly decorative.</p>

<p><i>Byam Shaw</i>, still a young man, is just such another master of decorative
lines. At the age of twenty-five he painted the picture &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Baubles,&rdquo;
which now hangs in the art gallery in Liverpool. The subject he took from
a poem in Rossetti&rsquo;s &ldquo;House of Life.&rdquo; Beautiful women snatch after the
fruit which a boy carries along on a salver. The whole is a harmony of
melodious lines and rich, quiet colours.</p>

<p>In his next picture, &ldquo;Truth,&rdquo; he ranges himself with Boutet de Monoel
or Ludwig von Zumbusch: he strives after the monumental effect that the
figures of old Brueghel have.</p>

<p>Next to Byam Shaw, <i>G. E. Moira</i> is the chief representative of this decorative
school. His picture of Pelleas and Melisande is a work quite out of the
ordinary, original in arrangement, incisive, almost bitter in colour, dull-green,
black, lilac, and yellow; fine in the atmosphere of Maeterlinck that pervades
the whole. But he does his best work as a decorator, not as a painter of
pictures that can be taken away from their setting. In the frieze with which
he decorated the Trocadéro Restaurant in London he, for the first time, made
use of polychrome relief, that since has played such an important part in
the art of decoration, and sought to enhance the colour effect still more by
the use of metal. In the Paris Exhibition he attracted considerable attention
by the pictures with which he decorated the pavilion of the Peninsular and
Oriental Steamship Company&mdash;simple lines and fantasies of colour which
with their delicate, flowing harmony had an effect like music. His designs
for stained-glass windows have the same qualities, and in his position as professor
in the National College of Art at South Kensington he is bound to
exert a great influence over the younger generation.</p>

<p><i>Anning Bell</i>, well known by his design for the cover of the <i>Studio</i>, has
also done excellent work in coloured relief, especially in his frieze &ldquo;Music
and Dancing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Maurice Greiffenhagen</i> surprises one by the ardour of his imagination,
his strong emphatic line, and the tapestry-like beauty of his colour. He
reminds one of Aman-Jean, such a wonderful &ldquo;old-master-like&rdquo; beauty is
suffused through the picture &ldquo;The Sons of God looked upon the Daughters of
Men.&rdquo; No less effective is the &ldquo;gourmandise&rdquo; with which he gives his interpretation
the appearance of an old picture. The colours, though full of sound
and movement, are at the same time so etiolated and faint that one would
think the picture had hung for centuries in a dusty corner of an old church, or
that spiders had spun their webs across it; the frame too is in keeping, and
enhances the general effect of solemnity.</p>

<p>The same style is found in the later work of <i>Frank Brangwyn</i>, who began
by painting out-of-door pictures in the spirit of the French Impressionists,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>403</span>
and afterwards, thanks to a visit to the East, was brought into touch with
Nature saturated in colour and massive in feature.</p>

<p>All his works are imposing through the decisive way in which he builds
up his masses, and the wonderful, rhythmical articulation of forms and colours
combined. The picture &ldquo;Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrh&rdquo; which has been
given a place in the Luxembourg, and the large mural painting &ldquo;Commerce
and Navigation&rdquo; in the Royal Exchange in London, are up to now his
strongest work.</p>

<p><i>F. Cayley Robinson</i>, who arrests one&rsquo;s attention with his austere, almost
heraldic arrangement of line, and his gloomy acerbity of colour; <i>Miss Eleanor
Fortescue Brickdale</i>, who awoke high hopes with her picture &ldquo;The Deceitfulness
of Riches&rdquo;; and that spirited draughtsman, W. Nicholson, whose
drawings lead the eye to and fro, backwards and forwards, along heavy
decided lines, noting every expressive turn and movement. Almost all these
masters have come to us from the applied arts. It was the idea of attaining
to unity of effect in decorative ornament that impelled these artists
to work in the spirit of to-day, not that each should bring forward his own
work of art and let it stand by itself, but that the scheme of decorative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>404</span>
architecture, modelling, and painting should work together hand in hand in
a homogeneous scheme of decoration.</p>

<p>With all these artists one cannot help noticing that they owe much in
the way of light and leading to one who in England, the land of poems-in-paint,
proclaimed more outspokenly than anyone else the principle of &ldquo;Art
for art&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo;&mdash;to the great American, James M&lsquo;Neill Whistler.</p>
